<!--more-->

*This post is part of a series of posts about the Hege DAO, see [How To Use the
Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao/) for an introduction and overview.*

## How to write a good proposal

When writing a proposal for the Hege DAO, here are some guidelines for you to
follow to make the proposal clear and easy to understand for DAO members.

When your proposal is ready, see [How to Create a
Proposal](/blog/how-to-create-a-proposal-in-the-hege-dao/) to learn how to
submit your proposal to the Hege DAO.

If you have any questions, get stuck, or just want some feedback, just drop into
our [Telegram Hegequarters](https://t.me/Hegequarters) and ask for guidance.

Below the instructions ont his page, you will also find two examples to help you
get a sense of how to write your own proposal.

- [Example Proposal 1: A Reddit Competition](#example-proposal-1-a-reddit-competition)
- [Example Proposal 2: Update the Hege Docs Website](#example-proposal-2-update-the-hege-docs-website)

## Step 1: Write a title for your proposal

First you need to write a short title that describes what it is that you want to
request funds for. For example "10,000 $HEGE for a Reddit competition", "Update
the Hege Docs website".

## Step 2: Write a description for your proposal

After having a good title, you need to write a description for your proposal.
This is where you lay out your pitch to convince the members of the DAO why they
should vote yes to your proposal.

In short, your proposal should make it clear:

- What you are going to to
- How it will benefit Hege

Use the following sections to structure your proposal.

### Proposer

Here you put your name.

### Amount requested

Here you put the amount of $HEGE that you want.

### Description

Here you describe your proposal in detail. What exactly is it that you are going
to do?

### Motivation

Here you describe why you think your proposal is a good idea. What is the
purpose of your proposal? Why is it worth doing?

### Expected Outcome

Here you describe what you expect the outcome of your proposal will be. In what
ways will this outcome benefit Hege, in the short and in the long term?

### Budget Breakdown

Here you can put more details of how you are going to spend the funds.

### Timeline

Here you put down a rough timeline of your work. When will you start? How long
will it take?

### Footnotes

This section is optional. If you want to add some context, you can do so here.

## Example Proposal 1: A Reddit Competition

Here is an example proposal for holding a Reddit competition.

### Proposer

Hege Team

### Amount requested

10,000 $HEGE

### Description

To organize a Reddit writing competition aimed at promoting the newly launched
Hege DAO. Participants will write an original post of at least 100 words,
mentioning both the Hege DAO and $HEGE. Each entry must be shared across a
minimum of 5 crypto-related subreddits. Submissions should be creative,
authentic, and not fully AI-generated. Originality will be a key judging factor.

### Motivation

Boost awareness of the Hege DAO and the broader Hege brand on Reddit. Encourage
creative community engagement and participation.

### Expected Outcome

Growth in Hege DAO memberships and an increase in the number of $HEGE holders.
Greater visibility for Hege across Reddit’s crypto communities.

### Budget Breakdown

The top post, as voted on by the community through the newly launched DAO, will
receive a prize of 10,000 $HEGE.

### Timeline

October 25–27, 2025 (3 days)

## Example Proposal 2: Update the Hege Docs Website

Here is an example proposal for updating the Hege Docs website.

### Proposer

Day

### Amount Requested

5,000 $HEGE

### Description

Update the Hege docs website at docs.hegecoin.com.

- Update the content to reflect all that has happened in Hege since the docs site was last updated.
- Convert the existing site to a static HTML website using Hugo (see footnote).
- Move the site from Webflow to GitHub Pages.
- Document the workflow, and set up a process to make sure the site is kept up to date.

### Motivation

- Get the documentation up to date, and keep it up to date. Outdated content makes us look bad.
- Changing to a static website will make it easer to maintain and update.
- Moving the site off Webflow will save roughly 100 USD per month.
- Hosting the site and its source code on GitHub will make it easier for others to contribute.

### Expected Outcome

A new and updated documentation site for Hege. This will not have a direct
impact on the visibility of Hege, and is not likely to attract new investors in
the short term. But having a good and up-to-date documentation is important if
we want to call ourselves serious.

### Budget Breakdown

5,000 $HEGE as a small compensation for the work.

### Timeline

The new site will be ready by November 14, 2025.

### Footnotes

Hugo is a so called Static Site Generator (SSG) built in the programming
language Go. It makes it easy to create small and fast websites with mostly
static content (such as documentation pages). It is mature, well maintained, and
well documented. This makes it the best choice for the Hege documentation site.
See gohugo.io.
