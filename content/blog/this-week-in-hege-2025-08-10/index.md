**_For the week of August 3—10_**

Hi Hegends and welcome to another issue of This Week in $HEGE! As usual there's
been lots going on. In this week's edition we'll cover our latest addition to
the League of Hegends, the new DRiP set that just dropped, and the long-awaited
Hege plushie now available in the Hege Merch Store.

Enjoy!

## In the markets, Ethereum stole the show

Before we get into Hege, let's start off with a short market update as usual.

Last week, as markets were down after the tariff and job numbers scares, we had this to say about the stock market:

> If we take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, so far this
> pull back is not large, and it could well turn into a normal correction in a
> strong uptrend.

... and this about bitcoin:

> [...] The [BTC] breakout has not been invalidated, and the price target
> remains at $142k. So with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any
> tops.
>
> Let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s
> tariff news. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the
> most rational.

And well, that turned out to be the right call. Stocks bounced back. Bitcoin bounced back. Alts bounced back.

But the one that really stole the show last week of course was Ethereum. A big pump took it straight through the $4,000 level that has been holding it down since almost 18 months back. The old all time high from 2021 around $4,900 is not far off now.

ETH finally getting its groove back after having been struggling for so long (especially compared to BTC) is very promising for the upcoming alteason we're all looking for. Fingers crossed!

## Welcome to the League of Hegends, PlantFaceAsh!

Turning to Hege news, on Monday the [League of Hegends](/league-of-hegends/) got
a new member: [PlantFaceAsh](/league-of-hegends/plantfaceash/).

Nobody is more worthy of a place among the great Hegends than Ash, and JB put it best:

> A myth. A man. A Hegend. PlantFaceAsh (AKA MMAlegend6969 AKA do NOT f*ck
> with me) has helped truly make Hegecoin what it is today—a brand. From
> working with artists to establish Hegecoin on DRiP, to nearly singlehandedly
> crafting the merchandise store, to laying the smackdown to FUD-ers and
> scammers in chat (and recently, even exposing a scammer outside of the
> community), PlantFaceAsh has solidified himself as one of the most Hegendary
> Hegends in the space. We are eternally grateful for his help, his
> persistence, his creativity, and most importantly, his extensive use of 69.

You're a beast Ash! Hege is both lucky and proud to have you with us. 🦔❤️
