Hello Hegends and welcome to the brand new Hege Blog!

We’ve been secretly cooking on this one for the last couple of weeks and now
it’s ready for you all to see.

## What is the Hege Blog?

The Hege Blog is a new blog-style section on our website where we will post
weekly project updates, showcase our awesome artwork, announce competitions, and
other stuff like that. Basically it will be the go-to place to stay up to date
with what’s happening in Hege.

## Why a blog?

Well, it’s pretty simple: a blog is a great communications channel for us.

A blog will help us reach people outside of social networks. Also we don’t risk
getting banned and lose our audience. And with our own blog, we have full
control over both branding and content.

And very importantly, it will also help us rank higher in Google searches, plus
make it more likely for AI:s to pick up info about Hege. Both of which are very
important to help us reach more people!

## How you can help out

There are a couple of ways you can help get the Hege Blog going:

- Share the blog posts across social media, and with friends and family.
- If you want to write an article for us to post, go for it! It doesn’t even have to be about crypto, you can write about anything you’re passionate about. If your work meets our standards, we’ll be happy to publish it.
- Test the blog (and the rest of the website) on all different devices and browsers that you have access to. If you find anything that doesn’t work or looks wrong, ping @itsdayagain on Telegram!

That's it. Thank you for reading. Stay Hegendary!
