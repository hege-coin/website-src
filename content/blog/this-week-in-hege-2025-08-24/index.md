While all eyes were on Mr. Powell speaking at Jackson Hole, Hege announced
taking over a popular memecoin subreddit, and a new Hegend was welcomed into the
League of Hegends. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of August 18—24_**

Hey Hegends, time for another weekly update! Team Hege has spent the week
heads-down focused on getting things done as usual. In this week’s edition, read
on to find out why yo yo is such a Hegend, and how we’re sponsoring
[r/Memecoinhub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Memecoinhub/) for an entire month.

Let’s jump in!

## Powell spoke, markets rejoiced

In the markets, up until Friday this week felt pretty bleak to be honest,
especially for smallcaps in general, and memecoins in particular. Powell was set
to speak at the Jackson Hole conference on Friday, and it seemed everybody and
their grandmother were just waiting to be fed whatever small crumbs they could
get about the prospect of a September rate cut.

Then Friday came. Powell spoke, the markets listened. And apparently they were
very happy with what they heard: Stocks pumped. Bitcoin pumped. Both Ethereum
and BNB put in new all time highs. Bitcoin dominance dropped. Altseason is ON!

As of writing this on Sunday morning, bitcoin has not yet closed the week. But
most likely it will end another week consolidating after the breakout in early
July. The price target of $142k remains. Note that this is a conservative price
target; it might well end up going a lot higher.

Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance keeps dropping. Meaning the big altseason is still
in play. At some point during the next couple of months, dominance will likely
bounce. This could be because the whole market corrects, or because bitcoin sets
off on its next leg up. Looking at the daily chart, 55.5% could be where it
finds support. But that’s mostly speculation, as always we'll have to keep
watching the charts week by week and take things as they come.

In summary, let’s see how the coming week plays out, but for now everything looks good!

## Welcome to the League of Hegends, yo yo!

On Thursday we were happy to introduce [yo yo](/league-of-hegends/yo-yo/) into the [League of Hegends](/league-of-hegends/).

<p>
Yo yo has been with Hege since the earliest days, a true OG in the League of Hegends. On his own initiative, and never for profit, he’s sent over 277 sticker packages <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNKztrlR9U" target="_blank">around the world</a>, spreading Hege like a <a href="https://youtu.be/H7AzdGhhqtc?si=IX0VLiMPd4YDLyzl" target="_blank">sleeper</a> that never stops spinning.</p>
<p>
Details about him are scarce, but his username hints at power beyond measure, maybe even enough to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k25KK79-E4" target="_blank">split the atom</a>. What we do know is that yo yo keeps the community looping together: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCxQkb_xMFw?si=x7yD1cfEwJcFM6i1" target="_blank">walking the dog</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oYiUkbBC6dY?si=tI_M30mfdRzyyQz0" target="_blank">rocking the baby</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/NMGvkQvqeFs?si=4a4V6TRFEshxWQ58" target="_blank">eiffel towering</a> his generosity, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvdIQOd67xg" target="_blank">Around the corner</a> with every new drop, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-V9KngiL2Y" target="_blank">brain twister</a>-level dedication that no one saw coming.
</p>
<p>
Some heroes fight with swords, others with words. Yo yo fights with stickers. He’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_-zympXLB8" target="_blank">man on the flying trapeze</a>, keeping the vibe alive with every package. And just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syYF_zV0h5g" target="_blank">boingy-boing</a> or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFBKNwssCio" target="_blank">loop the loop</a>, no matter how far he travels, he always comes back to Hege. Catch him if you can, but don’t get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWgFvqmXmUg" target="_blank">strung</a> along.
</p>
