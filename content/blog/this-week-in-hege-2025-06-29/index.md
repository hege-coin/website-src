Good afternoon Hegends and welcome to another weekly update from Team Hege. We’ve got some good stuff for you this week, so let’s dive in!

## Did markets bottom last week?

If you listened to the doomposters on X, last Sunday the sky was falling and WW3
was imminent. Then suddenly a ceasefire deal was struck between Israel and Iran,
and just like that, the markets were back to pumping. This is exactly why we try
to not pay too much attention to whatever the narrative of the week is in the
news.

Stock markets are back to all time highs. Bitcoin is not there quite yet, but it
looks strong, and most likely it will also move on to new highs. Altcoins are
obviously another story, as retail investors have not yet come back. This is
frustrating of course. But as long as BTC keeps moving up, we believe that
eventually retail will return, memecoins will be back in focus, and we will get
our time to shine.

## There’s a new raid bot in town

Exit old bot. Enter Raidar, our new X raiding bot for Hegequarters.

With this new bot, we’ve really stepped up our raiding game. It’s much easier
for us to manage raids now, and it’s much easier to participate too.

To kick things off, this week we ran a Raid2Earn campaign and it was a smash hit.

Here are the stats:

👥 Participants: **162**  
🌡 Total combined XP: **45,616**  
💰 Distributed Rewards: **42,735 $HEGE**

Also congrats to the top raider @Change_big for taking home the 5,000 $HEGE bonus!

Next week we’ll kick off a fresh raid competition from Monday to Friday,with a
race for the top 10. Stay tuned!

Big thanks to Ollie for organizing this.

## Up ahead in the coming week

As mentioned above, a new raid competition will be running from Monday to
Friday, so don’t miss that!  All info will be announced in Hegequarters.

We’ve also been cooking on a new Vegas advertising campaign for the month of
July. We don’t want to spoil too much on this one, but it will include maps that
will be handed out to people on the strip.

## Thanks for reading!

That’s it for this week. Thanks everybody for helping out making Hege the best community around. We have come far, but we still have so much more ahead. Thank you for being a part of the journey!
