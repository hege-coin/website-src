Welcome to the definitive guide for using the Hege DAO.

## Introducing the Hege DAO

The Hege DAO gives $HEGE holders a direct voice in how some of the project’s treasury is used, from community events to marketing initiatives. 

The Hege DAO is built on Solana, through the trusted Realms platform, making decisions transparent, verifiable, and automatically executed once a vote passes. The DAO doesn’t replace the core team, but adds a structured way for holders to participate in key funding decisions.

## What is the Hege DAO?

"DAO" is short for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization", and in simple terms you can think of the Hege DAO as a treasury wallet that is fully owned by the Hege community. The members of the Hege DAO all come together to control how funds are spent from this wallet. This works by creating proposals, and then voting on them. 

For example, let’s say Ryan wants to host a Hege-themed quiz and needs 50,000 $HEGE for prizes. He submits a proposal asking the DAO to transfer those tokens. Once submitted, members have 3 days to vote “yes” or “no.” If the majority votes “yes,” the transfer happens automatically. If “no,” the proposal is rejected and no funds move.

The Hege DAO is hosted on Realms, and can be found on this address: https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy
