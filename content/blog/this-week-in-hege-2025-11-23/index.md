As even good earnings from Nvidia failed to lift markets, Hege continued to up
the meme game. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of November 17–23, 2025_**

GM Hegends!

This is Day back at the keyboard as usual, checking in for a short update on
what's been going on since last Sunday. This week winter came to Sweden. And
well, it seems winter came to the markets, too. Bitcoin broke down, and so did a
whole bunch of altcoins.

But, market chaos notwithstanding, it was a pretty regular week in Hege.

First off, go watch [the replay](https://youtu.be/S-62tcurlBo) of TA Tuesday if
you didn't catch it.

Second, for this past Friday's HEGE Experience X space,
[Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83) had invited back
[Megan](https://x.com/meganwestsol) and [Nev](https://x.com/XO12XX) from DRiP to
talk all about what's going on over there. Check out [the
replay!](https://x.com/i/spaces/1djxXWAopgjJZ)

Third, Chris kept busy cooking up more Hege memes. But more about that after the
market update below.

Let's dive in!

## Bitcoin broke down, altcoins followed

This was not a pretty week in the markets.

Not even Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday could perk
up trad-fi markets. And even less so crypto. So in other words, we got good news
for the AI narrative to continue, but even that failed to hold markets up.

Failing to pump on good news like that is not a good sign. At least not for the
near future. It's much too early to call a top in stock markets, as there are
likely many people waiting on the sidelines to buy dips. But we should be
prepared for a larger correction. How long could such a correction last? Wild
guess a month or two perhaps.

In crypto, as we feared last week, bitcoin did break down. This was the first
failed breakout all the way since the bull market started back in early 2023.
It was also the first break of the 50 week SMA since early 2023. This is
significant, and until we see clear signs on a bottom being in, caution now
calls for risk-off.

How low could bitcoin go? The next big support below is around the area of
$73k-$76k. As long as bitcoin keeps above that level, it doesn't look too bad
long term, as that would keep the structure of higher lows intact. Should it break
down below $70k however, it starts looking a lot worse.

After a big drop like this, there will come a strong bounce at some point.
However, whenever this bounce comes, we must expect that people will sell into
it. So stay very cautious.

The markets have been rough, but the work goes on. The flip side to this market
breakdown is that as painful as it is right now, this will lead to absolutely
amazing crypto opportunities in the future, for those who stick around.
