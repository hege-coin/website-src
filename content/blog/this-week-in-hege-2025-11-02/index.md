This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**For the week of October 27 — November 2, 2025**

GM Hegends!

Another week down. As we all know the market has not been kind to memecoins
lately. Or to altcoins in large for that matter. Looking beyond the charts
though, there has actually never been more things going on in Hege than in the
past month.

In only the last couple of weeks, we've partnered with [Mattle.fun](https://x.com/mattlefun/status/1977977506168021498), [released
Hege Dash](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1980656370602197124) on the PSG1,
launched the [Hege DAO](https://www.hegecoin.com/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao),
and
[dropped](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/0249bd5e-428b-4eec-b16a-8849e219d0cd)
[several](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/8dee2191-1581-42a1-a814-a336bb0e2dcd)
[DRiP](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/3e271946-84b3-4b88-b78c-0acad8ccdf27)
[sets](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/436a5ea9-eb05-4dca-9c3e-4bdb36d16b1e).
Then on the community side we've introduced The HEGE Experience X spaces with
[Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83), and [TA Tuesdays](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1oiil14/replay_of_ta_tuesday_with_day_october_28/) with Day every week.

This week, the two stories we're highlighting are the latest Halloween-themed
DRiP snapshot, and the release of the Hege Mania game.

Let's dive in!

*(No video version this week, sorry!)*

## The Fed cut rates, but Powell threw some cold water on the party

First a quick look at what happened in the markets this week.

The week started out good. Stock markets put in new all time highs, frontrunning
US rate cuts, tech earnings, and good news coming out of Trump's visit to Asia.
Then came Wednesday and Powell's press conference after the announcement of
the expected 25 bps rate cut.

At the press conference, Powell did his best to drive home the point that a
further cut in December is far from a foregone conclusion.  The US job market is
holding up reasonably well, while the danger of increasing inflation still
looms. This was apparently not what the markets wanted to hear, and so they sold
off towards the end of the week, as they adjusted to the prospects of the Fed
cutting rates more slowly than expected.

However, it's probably a mistake to focus too much on the short term actions of
the Fed right now. The fact is that the US economy is holding up, tech earnings
came in pretty good, and the US and China are seeking to de-escalate their trade
war. These are all fundamentally positive things, and as long as the charts
don't start signalling tops, there is no reason to be bearish yet.

This is also reflected in the bitcoin chart, which looks to close another week
above support at $109k. This means that the price target of $142k is still in
play, and the hope of a coming altseason is not yet dead.

## 🎃 Hallowee[d] DRiP 🎃

Enough of the markets, now over to Hege.

Hege has been crazy active over on DRiP lately. First there was the [collab with
Deftony](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/8dee2191-1581-42a1-a814-a336bb0e2dcd),
then [B&W
October](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/3e271946-84b3-4b88-b78c-0acad8ccdf27),
and now this week there is not one but two new sets: 

- [Inktober color](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/436a5ea9-eb05-4dca-9c3e-4bdb36d16b1e)
- [Halloweed](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/9dd2df86-56fd-4834-9a63-598b99400258)

Go check them out, and a big shout-out to [V](https://x.com/xIAMVx) for the
