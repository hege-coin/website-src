Bitcoin is stumbling, but Hege stands firm, literally spreading light in the
world. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of November 10–16, 2025_**

GM Hegends!

It's Sunday again and that means it's time for another rundown of what went down
in the Hege-verse this week. While the markets have not been kind to us
crypto-lovers lately to say the least, we've been keeping pretty busy on the
building front.

First off, as usual Day held another TA Tuesday, go check out [the replay](https://youtu.be/3DDnga304Lg) if
you missed it. Then also as usual, [Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83) was back
hosting another [HEGE Experience X space](https://x.com/deftony83/status/1989378224036692434). This one was all about burnout, and
more importantly how to avoid it. Burnout is no joke, so go have a listen if you
didn't catch it live!

For the main pieces this week, read on for more about our charity work with
Little Sunshine Pledge, and coming updates to our website.

Let's dive in!

## In the markets, the crypto sell-off continued

First a short look at the markets, as per usual.

In tradfi, the US government shutdown ending this week failed to cheer the
markets up. Instead they started pricing in lower expectations for a December
rate cut, partly due to the lack of data caused by said shutdown.

This obviously didn't help crypto, which saw a continued sell-off this week. In
fact, crypto markets have been weak ever since bitcoin's failed breakout to new
all time highs back in early October.

The week is not over yet, but it looks likely that bitcoin will close well below
$100k this week, after holding it last week. This means a close below the 40
week EMA, below the 50 week SMA, and below the invalidation level for the July
breakout.

Not a pretty picture. Unless we get a pump today, this means the price target of
$142k is now invalidated.

Could this be a fake-out to the downside? Sure, it could. But on the weekly,
this would be the first failed breakout all the way back since early 2023, and
also the first close below the 50 week SMA. That's significant, and something we
need to take seriously.

We'll have to wait until tonight's close to be sure, but right now it's not
looking good.

The one peculiar thing is that while crypto has been selling off, bitcoin
dominance has actually gone down. Meaning altcoins have on average been stronger
than bitcoin. It's still too early to draw any conclusions about this, however.

## Hege ❤️ Tue Minh Orphanage

Now on to more positive news!

This was something that happened in late October, but we haven't covered it here
before.

We are very proud to have sponsored the installation of solar power at the Tue Minh
Orphanage in southern Vietnam. This was done through the non-profit organization
[Little Sunshine Pledge](https://x.com/SunshinePledge). Thanks to them, and thanks
to our donation, the kids at the orphanage now have access to solar electricity to
power lighting, cooking, charging, or whatever else they need.

As thanks, our name is now engraved in a plague at the orphanage. Very cool!

See our [announcement tweet](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1981931977365488120)
for more info. And thank you for what you do, Little Sunshine Pledge — you're
amazing ☀️

## The Hege website is being moved

Last week we mentioned a [DAO proposal to move the hegecoin.com
website](https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy/proposal/73Apom8JTHgTRqQs5FHxTUcPDYtbxU8GVz4dDQE8NTs8).
After voting, the proposal passed and Day has now started working on it.

For a little bit of background on this, right now our website is built on a
platform called Webflow. This is a great all-in-one platform for beginners to
build websites. It's easy to use and it works okay. But when you move past a
certain point, it becomes a drag rather than a help. We have now reached that
point, and some things we want to add to the website we simply can't do in
Webflow. It's also very expensive, costing us around 250 USD per month.

The DAO proposal linked above describes a plan for moving our website off of
Webflow, and cleaning up a bunch of things behind the scenes.

This is one of those things that won't have a big visible impact: after the
move, the site will look a little cleaner, and load a little faster, but it will
look more or less the same. The main benefits here are 1) laying a ground for
adding more things in the future, and 2) saving us around 250 USD per month in
operational costs.

This is a good project to do while markets are slow, and we expect it to be
fully done by the end of December.

## Coming up ahead

As usual, on Tuesday Day will be back with more charts for you TA geeks.

## Thanks for reading

And with that another week in $HEGE comes to an end. Thanks for reading, and
fingers crossed the markets perk up a little leading into Christmas time. But
regardless, we'll be back next week with a fresh update. Have a great week fam!
