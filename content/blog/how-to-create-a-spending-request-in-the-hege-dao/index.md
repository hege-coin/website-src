<!--more-->

*This post is part of a series of posts about the Hege DAO, see [How To Use the
Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao/) for an introduction and overview.*

## How to create a spending request

**NOTE: To create a spending request, you must first be a member of the Hege
DAO. If you are not already a member, please follow the instructions in [How to
Become a Member of the Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-become-a-member-of-the-hege-dao/),
and then come back here.**

This article will show how to create a **spending proposal** for spending funds
from the DAO treasury. (If you want to make a poll proposal to just get the
opinion about something from the members in the Hege DAO, see [How to Create a
Poll in the Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-create-a-poll-in-the-hege-dao/) instead.

## When you are a member of the Hege DAO, here is how to create a spending request

 1. Go to the [Hege DAO page on
 Realms](https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy).
 Connect your wallet. It should look something like this. You can see how many
 $HEGE tokens you have deposited in the upper right corner, right next to the
 banner. *(NOTE: You must have at least 10,000 $HEGE deposited to make a
 proposal. See [How to Deposit and
 Withdraw](/blog/how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-hege-from-the-hege-dao/) to learn
 how to deposit tokens.)*
