As bitcoin tried to decide which way it wants to go, Hege kept moving and
announced the new League of Hegends to honor our amazing contributors. Welcome
to This Week in Hege.

**_For the week of July 21 – July 27_**

Hello Hege fam, here’s a fresh weekly update from your favorite team. This week
we announced a new listing on Bitrue Alpha, and unveiled the League of Hegends
as the next step to make our community even stronger.

Let’s dive in!

## Bitcoin consolidated for one more week

Let’s start with a short market update.

In tradfi, stock markets across the world had a good week and overall everything
looks great. In the US, both the S&P500 and the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100
closed at all time highs. There is simply nothing bearish about tradfi right
now. Which is exactly where we want it to be for crypto to do well.

About Bitcoin, last week we had this to say:

“after having spent this week consolidating after the breakout, next up we’re
looking for BTC to resume the rally in the week to come.”

This was obviously premature, as BTC spent also this week consolidating after
its big breakout. The capital management firm Galaxy Digital [announced on Friday](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Executes-One-of-the-Largest-Notional-Bitcoin-Transactions-Ever/default.aspx)
that they had successfully completed the selling of over 80,000 BTC on the
behalf of an early bitcoin whale. Part of this sale was likely what caused
Friday’s dip.

The fact that the market could absorb an enormous sale like this and still not
move down much is a very good sign. Looking at the bitcoin chart, it tells the
same story: very much still bullish, with a conservative price target of $142k.

In the altcoin space, this week we saw a pullback across the board. So far this
looks like a healthy correction, with nothing yet to suggest that the recent
altcoin rally has peaked.

In summary, our view remains that this bull market is far from over, so let’s
see what the next week brings.

## $HEGE listed on Bitrue Alpha

In Hege news, we’re happy to announce that $HEGE is now available for trading on
Bitrue Alpha.

After last week’s press release, Ollie took this opportunity to follow up with
another round. This time the release was posted across 6 more traditional news
outlets. It took some work to get Hege approved by these, but now that we’re
approved, future postings will be easier. Having Hege featured in these places
is great for us, and it’s something we will keep doing whenever we think the
time is right.

[The article

is excellent. Go have a read and share it on all your socials!

## Announcing: the League of Hegends

From day one, Hege has been a community effort — without our community, we
simply wouldn’t exist. Because of this, we’re constantly thinking about how to
make it stronger, and how to show our appreciation for all the amazing people in
it.

So we came up with the concept of the League of Hegends. It will be our way of
showing respect to the ones who time after time have shown selfless dedication
to the Hege vision.

So what is this League of Hegends? It’s an exclusive league that holds the
top-tier members of the Hege community. Starting out with three Hegends, over
time the Hege team will keep selecting new members into the league, creating an
ever-growing  monument to honor all the amazing people who made Hege possible.
Being selected into the league means having your name forever etched into Hege
history, and it's the ultimate token of respect and appreciation.

The league can be viewed on the new [League of Hegends
page](/league-of-hegends/) here on our website. On this page, each person who
has been selected into the league is displayed, represented by an artwork
custom-made just for them, along with the reasoning for why they were picked.

Over time, more and more members will be added to the league, making it bigger
and bigger. There will not be a fixed schedule as to when we will add new
Hegends, but to get a rough idea, expect a new introduction every few weeks. And
of course, every new pick will get their own custom artwork.

For the launch, Flo, Vector, and Ryan were selected for their outstanding
contributions. Congratulations and thank you for your service, all the three of
you are amazing!
