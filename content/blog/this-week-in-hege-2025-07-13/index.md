As bitcoin bulls finally got the overhand and charged ahead, Hege leveled up by
announcing a multi-pronged marketing campaign to kick off on July 14. Welcome to
this week in Hege!

**_For the week of July 7 – July 13_**

What a week huh?! Bitcoin finally got its act together and made a decisive move
into uncharted highs. Meanwhile we put in a massive 40% candle on Thursday,
showing everybody we’re still in the game (and only getting started!!)

Let’s dive in to what happened this week.

## In the markets, BTC broke out to new highs

This week, it was bitcoin’s turn to be the strong performer in the markets.
After meeting some resistance around the previous all time high early in the
week, on Thursday the bulls finally got the overhand, and charged into a
decisive breakout.

If BTC closes the week around this level tonight (which looks very likely!) we
have exactly the strong weekly breakout candle that we said we are looking for
in [last week’s update](/blog/this-week-in-hege-2025-07-06). In that case, the
chart becomes extremely bullish, and the next price target becomes 142k!

As a reminder, when talking about charts and price targets, we always have to
understand that technical chart analysis is never certain — it’s always about
probabilities. And right now the probabilities are saying it’s more likely than
not that BTC will reach 142k or higher in the coming months.

What we want to see in the coming week is for BTC to keep marching up, like it
did after the previous 3 breakouts. This would further increase the confidence
that this is indeed the start of the next big leg up, eventually leading to the
mythical alt season. Fingers crossed!

## In Hege, a new marketing campaign was unveiled

Turning to Hege, the big news this week was the announcement of our new marketing campaign.

Starting on Monday, July 14, we are launching a coordinated marketing campaign designed to build momentum through the rest of the month. We’re combining real-world presence, digital ad reach, community rewards, and brand storytelling to put HEGE in front of new audiences, and remind the crypto world what we’re still building.

To summarize, this is everything we have lined up for the coming week:

- Vegas Campaign (10,000 branded maps)
- DEX Screener Ads (100K impressions)
- Press release package (50+ outlets)
- Sticker competition ($250 in prizes or equivalent $HEGE)
- CryptoTwits Competition ($250 in prizes or equivalent $HEGE)
- X Raid Competition (20,000 $HEGE in prizes)
- Summer Merch Drop
- Bitrue Alpha Listing
- League of Hegends

As you can see, this is a coordinated push across multiple platforms, with rewards, online reach, and real-world presence. We can’t wait to get this one rolling!

You can read all the details in [the dedicated blog post](/blog/hege-marketing-campaign-july-2025/).
