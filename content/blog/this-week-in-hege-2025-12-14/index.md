## Bulls and bears are fighting it out

Last Wednesday the US Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. As expected. Markets
initially reacted positively, but then sold off a little on renewed AI jitters
towards the end of the week. In the big picture though, stocks are still very
strong, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq right under their previous all time
highs. No need to overanalyze this: for now, there is no sign of a stock market
top being in.

In crypto, it looks like bitcoin is going to close the week flat for the second
week in a row. There is an equilibrium right now, between permabulls jumping in
to buy the dip on the one side, and bears selling into the bounce after the
breakdown on the other. The question is which way the balance is going to tip
next.

On the daily bitcoin chart a bear flag is forming. Typically this is a sign of a
lower low to come. However, the bounce could continue higher before that
happens. To the upside, take out $95k, and $100k is up next. Otherwise, a
further dip towards $72k-76k looks increasingly likely.

The best approach in these situations is to wait for more clarity. Step aside
and let the bulls and bears duke it out. Live to fight another day.

## 🦠 The Cabal Plague: Chapter One 🦠 

It began beneath the surface. A corrupted hand breaks through the soil, carrying
the first pulse of the cabal infection into a sleeping market.

We wanted an ordinary cycle. A cycle where were vision, merit, and true
community were the hallmarks to be judged upon. But from the dinkiest of
basements, and from the highest halls of power alike, it spread. Corrupted
minds, having long forgotten true value, pushed their insidious schemes through
backroom deals, bundlers, and inside "influencers". Nobody left untouched by the
effects.

It's not the cycle that we wanted. But it's the one that we got. 

Now we adapt. When times are tough, Hegends step up. They fight back.
