## How to vote in the Hege DAO

**NOTE: To vote on a proposal, you must first be a member of the Hege DAO. If
you are not already a member, please follow the instructions in [How to Become a
Member of the Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-become-a-member-of-the-hege-dao/), and then
come back here.**

When you are a member of the Hege DAO, follow the instructions below to vote.

## How to vote 

1. Go to the [Hege DAO page on
Realms](https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy).
It should look something like this. Click "Connect Wallet" to connect your
wallet.

2. When you have connected your wallet, you can see how many $HEGE tokens you
have deposited in the upper right corner, right next to the banner.

3. Locate the proposal you want to vote for in the list of active proposals. Click it.

4. Now, the details for voting will depend on what kind of proposal you're
voting on. If it is a poll proposal, you will se a list of choices at the right
side of the page. If that's the case, continue on to the next step below,
otherwise skip to [How to vote on a spending
request](#how-to-vote-on-a-spending-request).

## How to vote on a poll 
 
1. To vote on a poll proposal, pick your desired choice among the choices on the
right side of the page. Then click "Vote". *(NOTE: if you instead see two
buttons labeled "Vote Yes" and "Vote No", then the proposal is a spending
request. If so, please jump to [How to vote on a spending
request](#how-to-vote-on-a-spending-request).*

2. Confirm the vote in your Solana wallet.

voting results will update to reflect your vote.

"Hege DAO" in the upper left corner of the page.

## How to vote on a spending request 

1. On a spending request proposal, you will see buttons to vote "Yes" or "No" on
the right side of the page. You will also see a link labeled "Instructions"
below the title of the proposal. Click the "Instructions" link. *(NOTE: if you
instead see one vote button with several choices above it, then the proposal is
a poll. If so, please jump to [How to vote on a
poll](#how-to-vote-on-a-poll)).*

2. Details about the instructions in the proposal will be shown. Here you can
see exactly how much funds were requested, and the address to which they will be
sent, should the proposal be accepted.

3. Now it's up to you as a member of the Hege DAO to judge if you think these
funds should be spend or not, and vote accordingly. Click "Vote Yes" if you
approve the transfer of the funds. Otherwise click "Vote No".
