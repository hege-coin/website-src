*This post is part of a series of posts about the Hege DAO, see [How To Use the
Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao/) for an introduction and overview.*

## How to create a proposal

**NOTE: To create a proposal, you must first be a member of the Hege DAO. If
you are not already a member, please follow the instructions in [How to Become a
Member of the Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-become-a-member-of-the-hege-dao/), and then
come back here.**

As a member of the Hege DAO, you can make two types of proposals:

1. **Poll proposal**. This type of proposal is only for getting the opinion from
members in the Hege DAO. There is no spending from the treasury connected to it.
2. **Spending request**. This type is for requesting funds from the treasury
wallet. The funds will be automatically transferred if the proposal passes the
vote.

Select the guide below for the type of proposal you want to create:
