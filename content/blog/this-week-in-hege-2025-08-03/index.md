While the markets threw a little tantrum over tariff news, the $HEGE sticker
contest continued, and the first ever Hege Hangouts weekly community call was
held. Welcome to This Week in Hege!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of July 28 — August 3_**

Wouldn't it be great if the big-wigs could just leave the markets alone, so we
can get that clean altseason we're all waiting for? Yea, we think so too. But
no, this week we got news about more tariffs instead. And what did the markets
do? Well they didn't like it, that's for sure.

But let’s not get too doom-and-gloomy here. We have a hunch that the crypto
markets are over-reacting. So we just keep doing what we do best: vibing and
building.

Let's dive in to what happened this week!

## In the markets, bitcoin pulled back

As usual, let’s start off with a short big picture market update to ground ourselves a bit.

In tradfi, stock markets had a good start of the week. Then came Wednesday, and
the US Fed announced that there would be no July rate cut. This was no surprise
at all, and the markets didn’t react much. What they did react to was the
following press conference, where chairman Powell refused to give any promises
of a September cut. This should have come as no surprise either, as Powell has
repeated over and over and again and again that they will always follow the
data. But still, the markets were apparently somewhat disappointed, and sold off
a little.

However, the bigger sell off came on Thursday and Friday, as Trump announced a
new barrage of tariffs that got everybody spooked. If we take a step back and
look at the bigger picture though, so far this pull back is not large, and it
could well turn into a normal correction in a strong uptrend.

Turning to bitcoin, despite following the rest of the market down, it closed the
week at $114k, still sitting well above the breakout point at $109k. The
breakout has not been invalidated, and the price target remains at $142k. So
with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.

Let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s tariff news. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.

## Hege Hangouts premiere

With the markets covered, let’s turn to Hege.

On Friday we premiered Hege Hangouts, our new weekly community call.

Hosted by Chris and Day, Hege Hangouts will feature discussions about Hege,
crypto, markets, and whatever else is going on in the world. Towards the end of
the show, we'll also open up the floor for listeners to ask questions, or talk
about whatever they want.

This first one was held on Telegram, but going forward we decided to move over
to X spaces instead. Because we think we can attract a bigger audience that way.
Expect the first few episodes to be a bit of trial and error as we figure out
the format and the topics to talk about, but we're really excited to see where
we can take this one.

Hege Hangouts. Every Friday. 15:00 UTC. On X.

See you there!

(Sadly, Day messed up the recording of Friday's call. So that one will be
forever lost in time 😢😢😢)

## New stickers for the $HEGE sticker contest

In other news, the $HEGE sticker contest continues. This week Chris made a dope
set of new stickers in addition to the classic ones.

You can download them from our Google Drive on the following link:

Chris says to ask the print shop for a printout on waterproof vinyl sticker
paper, letter size, 600DPI RGB.

The rest of the details you can find in [his excellent Reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1mbqg9x/hege_sticker_contest_350_usd_in_hege_up_for_grabs/).

Thanks Chris!

## Up ahead in the coming week

Don't miss the next Hege Hangouts. It will be hosted on X, on Friday, August 8,
at 15:00 UTC. Be there!

Meanwhile, we keep working on how to attract new holders. We have some
interesting ideas about new features that we’re discussing internally, and we’re
also thinking a lot about how to best promote what we already have. We can’t say
anything specific yet, but stay tuned!

## Thanks for reading

And that's it. Another week comes to an end, and a new one begins. As always,
we'll be back again next week with a fresh update. In the meantime, have a great
week and thanks again for being part of the Hege journey!
