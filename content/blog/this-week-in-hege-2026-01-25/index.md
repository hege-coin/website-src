In this inaugural update for 2026, two new banger sets dropped on DRiP, a fresh banner
made an entrance, and an NFT competition is underway. Welcome to This Week in
$HEGE!

<!--more-->

*For the week of January 19–25, 2026.*

## GM Hegends!

It's been a while fam! This is Day back at the keyboard again, putting together the
first *This Week in $HEGE* for 2026. 

As you all know, the market has been pretty damn awful lately. Bitcoin breaking
down in November sucked the last air out of the room, and everybody's just tired
and fed up with crypto right now. That's obviously not what we wanted, but it's
what we got, and now we just have to deal with it — our work continues, although
a little bit slower.

Myself I've been putting all my spare time into working on our website and doing
the TA Tuesdays. Meanwhile, the rest of Team Hege has been busy dropping two
new sets on DRiP, an NFT competition, and a fresh new banner for our socials.

Let's dive in!

## 🎁 Hegends Giveaway 🎁 

First up, a couple of days ago we announced a competition on X — we’re giving
away three Hegend NFTs, and it's super easy to enter.

Just as a reminder, here's why Hegends matter:

- They pay monthly rewards in $HEGE.
- You earn just by holding.
- No staking. No nonsense.

And here's how to enter the competition:

1. **Like + repost the tweet linked below.**
2. **Follow @HegeCoin on X.**

That's it.

## New Hege Banner for X, Reddit & DEX Screener 

You've probably noticed already, there's a fresh new banner on our X, Reddit, 
and DEX Screener pages. Before we had a different banner for each of these, so
it wasn't good for brand consistency. Now we have the same across all, which is
much better for our branding, and also the new one is such a banger compared to
the old ones.

Shoutouts to [@xIAMVx](https://x.com/xIAMVx) for the art, and to Chris for the art
direction!

## Coming Up Ahead

Because of the market being what it is, we've played it cool with the new Hege
Merch Store. Since there is no rush to get it out, we're taking our time to get
it right. Check out [this little
teaser](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/2013972725484912973) while you're waiting.

TA Tuesdays are continuing as before, every Tuesday at 17 UTC, live in
[Hegequarters](https://t.me/Hegequarters).

## Thanks for Reading

And with that the first update of the year is coming to an end. We're entering a
new year, with new possibilities, and we're all slightly anxiously excited to see
how it plays out.  2025 was not an easy year in crypto, that's for sure, so
here's to hoping that 2026 will be better.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for still being with us, you're all amazing!

Until next week,

*— Team Hege*
