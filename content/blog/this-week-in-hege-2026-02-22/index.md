Despite the grueling bear market, long term $HEGE holders still show high conviction.
Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

*For the week of February 16–22, 2026.*

## GM Hegends!

This week we're diving into some hard data about $HEGE holders. Are they really
so loyal and diamond handed as we want to believe they are?

The short answer is: Yes, they are!

@fr33nino had a look at the data. Let's dive in and see what he found.

## The Top 250 $HEGE Holders are 81% Diamond Handed

First off, let's have a look at the top 250 $HEGE holders.

Out of the top 250 holders, 81% are diamond handed, together controlling 73%
of the supply. (And this is even after removing the big CEX wallets from the
calculation.)

A diamond hand is defined here as a holder who held for 90 days or more.  But in
fact, most $HEGE diamond hands have held A LOT longer than that, as the average
time held for the top 250 wallets is 356 days.

This shows that despite the brutal bear market, Hege has a core community of
loyal holders who still believe in the project. They're weathering the storm,
waiting for the market to turn.

## A Wide Distribution Means Supply is Spread Across Many Whales

But only looking at the top holders data doesn't tell the whole story. In a
healthy holder base, the tokens must also be well distributed, with supply
spread over many different holders.

$HEGE has a distribution score of 3.00, a HHI of 59, and the median holder is
ranked at #69.

Are these numbers any good? Yes, we think they are. In fact, they're better than
many of the popular big memecoins, including SPX6900, PEPE, GIGA, and MOG (just
to mention a few).

## This Data Shows That Long Term Holders Still Believe in $HEGE

So what's the story all this data is telling us?

@fr33nino has this to say:

> In my opinion, what we see here is **long term holders still believing** in the
> project and slowly DCAing in to secure supply (and profit) while we wait for the
> markets to turn.
> 
> This might seem obvious, but the community buying this low does not only show
> **great conviction**, it also secures us a **steadier price action** and
> **healthier profit taking** during the reversal. Nobody holding, buying,
> working, supporting, enduring for a whole year would dump on this project for
> cheeseburger money on the way to ATH.
> 
> This is crucially important especially during (and after) a bear market, where
> scared investors are only looking for a quick way out. This is our safe haven.
> The Hege-fund.

Well said!
