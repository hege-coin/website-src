Starting July 12, HEGE is launching a coordinated marketing campaign designed to
build momentum through the rest of the month and finally leave the $10M market
cap behind us once and for all. Here's what we have planned!

<!--more-->

**_July Marketing Announcement_**

‍We’re combining real-world presence, digital ad reach, community rewards, and
brand storytelling to put HEGE in front of new audiences, and remind the crypto
world what we’re still building.

Let's dive in!

## 1/10 – HEGE is going back to Vegas

‍Over four weekends, 10,000 HEGE sponsored maps will be handed out on the Vegas
strip, putting our art, story, and brand directly into people’s hands.

To amplify the effect, we’ll also have walking billboards on the ground, real
people repping HEGE, sparking curiosity, and pushing the brand in one of the
world’s busiest tourist and leisure hubs. They will also be armed with Hege
branded can holders and badges to hand out as prizes to people on the strip!

This isn’t our first time in Vegas, but it will be bigger, louder, and more
coordinated than last time. It will also provide a bunch of great content for us
to post across Reddit and other socials.

## 2/10 – DEX Screener Ads

Starting July 14, HEGE will run ad placements across DEX Screener – one of the
most viewed sites in crypto. 100,000 impressions targeted at active traders.
Every chart watcher will be seeing HEGE in the corner of their screen.

## 3/10 – Press Release Package‍

On Monday we will be publishing a press release package to amplify the brandcoin
and merch narrative across 50+ crypto media outlets, including Associated Press,
CoinMarketCap, Binance Feed and many more.

The release will spotlight HEGE’s story, vision, and community, building
awareness as we scale. The hedgehog is making headlines!

how to pitch HEGE with energy, clarity, and conviction.

These won’t follow a fixed schedule, and will be announced ad-hoc as
opportunities pop up. If you want in, keep a close eye on the Headquarters next
week. Be sure to alert the chat if you find any opportunities!
