To celebrate the launch of the new Hege BuyBot in our
[Hegequarters](https://t.me/Hegequarters) Telegram channel, we're organizing a
BuyBot treasure hunt!

<!--more-->

## Listen Up Hegends! We’ve Hidden 10 Easter Eggs in the BuyBot

Each easter egg is triggered by buying $HEGE at a specific “magic number” dollar
amount between $20 and $1,000. These numbers are references to pop culture. It
could be anything, a movie quote, a video game reference, or general internet
lore (think $42 or $69).

Each easter egg comes with a picture or animation, and a text or quote for that
specific reference.

When you buy $HEGE at one of these amounts, the BuyBot will reveal the clue in
Telegram (the text clue will appear instead of the emojis).

**The Competition:**

As each hidden easter egg is found, the first 5 people to correctly guess what
the number refers to will each win $5 worth of HEGE! That’s $25 per easter egg,
for a total prize pool of $250.

**How To Participate:**

1. Join our [Hegequarters Telegram channel](https://t.me/Hegequarters).
2. Watch the BuyBot for easter egg messages (or try to trigger it yourself!)
3. Figure out what the magic number refers to (wink).
4. Be among the first five to guess correctly in Telegram (DM your answer to @fr33nino).

Down below you can see what easter eggs have already been solved so far, and the
winners for each one.
