Good afternoon fellow Hegends and welcome to the first weekly Hege project update!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of May 18 – May 25, 2025._**

This is Day writing on behalf of the entire Hege team. Starting today, I'll be
serving you up with a fresh update every Sunday about what's been cooking in the
team kitchen. Because you all deserve to know what's going on, and when we say
transparency is important to us, we really do mean it.

We're all in this together, and the only way our boy Hege is gonna catch the
girl of his dreams is if we work together. Team and community. Each and every
one of you is important, and you all have a part to play in making Hege the
success story we all know it's destined to be.

## Markets are heating up

Can you feel the shift in the collective crypto consciousness that’s been
building over the past week or two? Spring is in the air. Excitement is
returning. Bitcoin rallied up to new highs. Altcoin charts are starting to move.
Telegram is buzzing again. We're slowly waking up from winter hibernation.

It's still very early. There’s still uncertainty all around. And of course we
can never know for sure if this really is the start of the mythical alt season.
But we must also not be too afraid of stepping on the gas, and we believe this
is the right time to kick our efforts into a higher gear and unleash the next
phase of the Hege journey.

## $HEGE highlights of the week    

We started off the week by announcing that **we're now verified on Cryptotwits**. To
get things going, we're running a competition to spread the Hege vibes over
there. The response so far has been fantastic: we've been among their top 10
trending coins every day, and we even got a special shout out from their
official X account. If we keep it up, we have a chance to win a $10,000
marketing package from them. Big thanks to Ollie for seizing this opportunity,
and big thanks to the community for rallying in support!

Then on Wednesday we followed up by introducing our first ever **Hege
Disasterpiece Contest**. After the pros got their chance in the Jupiter contest,
we’re now inviting everybody to show their (lack of) skill and create epic MS
Paint-style Hege fan art. The more hilarious, the better. Bring on the chaos!
The competition runs to May 31st. Thanks to JC3 for coming up with the idea and
putting it all together!

Finally, to cap off the week, on Friday **we unveiled our full plans for the
upcoming marketing push**. It includes a listing on Bifinance, more Reddit
competitions, ramping up our TikTok presence, and a brand new merch store.

Check out the full announcement for all the details! It's pinned in Hegequarters
