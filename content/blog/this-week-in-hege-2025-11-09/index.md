As AI jitters shaked the market, Hegends NFTs entered Magic Eden's Gold Packs,
and Hege memes spread into normie-space. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of November 3–9, 2025_**

GM Hegends!

This week's edition will be all about NFTs and memes. On the NFT side, we're
very happy to have gotten our Hegends NFTs included in Magic Eden's Gold NFT
Packs. And on the meme side, we are making progress spreading the Hege presence
into the web2 space. Read on for more on this further down.

Those were not the only two things that happened in Hege this week though.
Here's the full list of what went down for you to check out on your own:

- [Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83) was back with another HEGE Experience X space ([replay here!](https://x.com/deftony83/status/1986840443858846010))
- Day held another TA Tuesday ([replay here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpXgWsUIVv4))
- Our [documentation website](https://docs.hegecoin.com/) has been updated and optimized.

## Crypto sold off on tradfi AI jitters

First a quick look at the markets, as usual.

In the wake of Powell's hawkishness last week, tradfi markets continued down on
worries that the crazy spending on AI is leading to a bubble.

To us it's pretty obvious that AI is indeed in a bubble, and that it will all
come crashing down at one point or another. But that doesn't mean it will crash
tomorrow, or even in three months from now. Usually, tops don't happen when
everybody's fearful, but on maximum greed. It's still very possible that this
recent fear is more a case of narrative following price than the other way
around: people see stocks naturally correcting after a rally, and they get all
anxious.

In the end, nobody knows, but trying to call tops is generally a losing game.
For all we know, markets could be back up at new all time highs in two weeks
from now. Or not. But until there are clear signs of tops in the charts, we'll
just have to wait and see.

Looking to the crypto charts, there is no denying that they have been showing
weakness. Bitcoin went all the way down to $99k during the week. It has since
bounced back a little bit, but it looks like the week is going to close well
below the $109k support level tonight. That level has held all the way since the
breakout back in early July, and losing it is not a show of strength. On the
other hand, $100k is still holding, keeping the price target at $142k still in
play.

So for now, patience is likely the winning strategy.

## Hegends have hit Magic Eden Gold Packs!

Enough markets. Let's $HEGE!

Our very favorite underhog has entered the Gold Pack game over at Magic Eden.

You can now rip open packs and pull Hegends alongside legends like [@FamousFoxFed](https://x.com/FamousFoxFed), [@GalacticGeckoSG](https://x.com/GalacticGeckoSG), and [@okaybears](https://x.com/okaybears).

And remember, holding a Hegends NFT also means ongoing, monthly rewards.

Check out the [announcement post](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1987082195257921588), read more about [Hegends NFTs](https://app.hegecoin.com), and go get some [Magic Eden Packs](https://magiceden.io/packs/solana/nft/gold)!

## Hege memes goes normie

Let's face it, crypto is still a very small world. There are tons and tons of
people that have no idea what's going on in our space. And we need to figure out
how to reach them, too.

So Chris has been working on this by creating memes that are not directly
related to crypto. This way, we can get people outside of crypto familiar with
the characters in the Hege universe.

This week, he created an AI-related meme (see below!) and posted it to big,
non-crypto subreddits. (Check out [the post on our
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1opqt6h/150k_views_and_counting/).)

It was definitely a success, as the posts generated over 200 comments and 200k
views!

We'll be doing more of this going forward. So please jump into the fray and join
the discussion when you see these posts going up.

HOWEVER! If you do. DON'T SHILL $HEGE IN THE COMMENTS! Join the discussion and
bring the positive Hege vibe. But don't even mention Hege or crypto. There are
two things normies absolutely hate right now, and that's AI slop and crypto
shillers. We are doing this to spread awareness of Hege, and even mentioning
crypto only gets in the way of that. So as much as you like to promote the coin,
please hold back!
