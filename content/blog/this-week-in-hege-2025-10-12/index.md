Overshadowed by the biggest wipeout in crypto history, Hege
plotted out the course for October, and the BuyBot treasure hunt is on. Welcome
to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of October 6 – 12, 2025_**

Lots of things happened in Hege this week. 

On Friday, Charlie hosted the second episode of The HEGE Experience. This time
he had invited [Megan](https://x.com/meganwestsol) and
[Neverland](https://x.com/XO12XX) from DRiP, who talked about the future of DRiP
and answered questions from listeners. It was a great space. Go [listen to the
replay](https://x.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzZlwWAWKv/peek) if you didn't catch it!

Earlier in the week, Day held a TA livestream covering the latest in the charts ([watch the replay here](https://youtu.be/A39H8dwgYGA)).

Then of course the big thing for the week was that we announced our roadmap for
October, and that we're launching the Hege DAO. More about that down below the
market update.

There is also a [video version of this article](https://youtu.be/Jyb38m_BnGE) on our YouTube channel.

With that said, let's jump in!

## Biggest liquidation event in crypto history

What a few weeks it's been in the crypto market. A fakeout to the downside in
late September was then followed by a week of rallying, culminating in a new
bitcoin all time high on Monday. Everything looked good.

Until Friday afternoon.

That's when the largest liquidation event in crypto history started. Seemingly
triggered by news of a deepening trade conflict between the US and China, crypto
started selling off along tradfi stock markets. But unlike in stocks, where the
dip was relatively mild, in crypto it escalated into the largest wipeout that
has ever taken place in the entire history of crypto.

On Binance, the largest crypto exchange, USDT pairs of many multi-billion dollar
altcoins wicked down 70-80% or even more, as altcoin traders got completely
annihilated across the board.

This bloodbath has 100 meter tall neon signs flashing MARKET MANIPULATION all
over it. This had nothing to do with China tariffs. That was just the trigger
for deep-pocketed insiders to set off a cascade of liquidations. My guess is
that it was several independent actors taking advantage of the situation even.
In any event, a few people got a whole lot richer, while thousands of holders
and traders got a whole lot poorer, as they were liquidated or sold in fear.

This event will be remembered in crypto history. But how it will be remembered
is still not clear. It could be the start of a downturn, or it could turn into a
small blip in an ongoing bull market.

My guess is a small blip. But for now, let's have a look at what the charts say.

Despite the chaos, BTC held up relatively well. On some exchanges it dipped all
the way down to $100k, but then soon recovered up above the old support level at
$109k. The week has not closed yet, but it looks likely it will close above
$109k, with the support level intact, and the price target of $142k remaining
for yet another week. As dramatic as Friday was, the bitcoin chart still holds up.

## October Roadmap announced

With the market mayhem covered, let's turn to Hege.

On Monday, we released the first part of our plans for Q4 and beyond!

The two big parts in this announcement were the Hege DAO, and the roadmap for
October. The Hege DAO will be the next step in leveling up the community side of
the project. The fact is that Hege would be nothing without the Hege community.
That's how it's always been, and that's how it should be. With the DAO, we're
taking the next step on the road to giving $HEGE holders more say in how the
project is run and where it will go in the future.

A separate announcement will be made when the DAO is launched. Most likely it
will happen within 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, you can read more details about the DAO and the October roadmap
in [the announcement blog post](https://www.hegecoin.com/blog/roadmap-q4-2025).

## The Hege BuyBot treasure hunt

To celebrate the release of the Hege BuyBot the other week, this week we kicked off
a BuyBot treasure hunt!

We've hidden a total of 10 easter eggs within the buy bot, each one triggered by
buying $HEGE at a specific “magic number” dollar amount between $20 and $1,000.
These numbers are references to pop culture. It could be anything, a movie
quote, a video game reference, or general internet lore (think $42 or $69).

Each easter egg comes with a picture or animation, and a text or quote for that
specific reference. When you buy $HEGE at one of these amounts, the BuyBot will
reveal the clue in Telegram, and set off a competition.

As each hidden easter egg is found, the first 5 people to correctly guess what
the number refers to will each win $5 worth of $HEGE! That’s $25 per easter egg,
for a total prize pool of $250.

Read more in the [blog
post](https://www.hegecoin.com/blog/the-hege-buybot-treasure-hunt-is-on) and
good luck!

## Coming up ahead

With the news covered, let's look to what's next!

the week. So stay tuned for that!

Second, on Tuesday it's time for another TA session with Day. It will be live in
[Hegequarters](https://t.me/Hegequarters), and also livestreamed on the [Hege Community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HegeCoinCommunity).

And finally, third (but not least!!), tune in to The HEGE Experience X space with
