As the claws of crypto winter eased their grip a little bit, Hege made a debut
on Capitoday's new shill spaces. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

*For the week of February 9–15, 2026.*

## GM Hegends!

Another week of crypto winter survival is down. Taking us one week closer to the
inevitable spring, and then the carefree sunny summertime we all dream of.

Also winters have their own swings in mood. Moving from weeks of arctic deep
hibernation when nothing stirs, to weeks when winds turn milder, offering
glimmers of renewed hope.

Yesterday was Valentines', and if you've got a special someone in your life, I
hope you gave them that little bit of extra TLC they deserve. Helena certainly
didn't hold back! 😂

In the Hege-verse, this week marked our first time on 
[@Capitoday's](https://x.com/capitoday) new shill spaces — big shout out and
thanks for having us on!

Let's dive in!

## Hege ❤️ Capitoday

Over the past couple of months, Hege has been one of the most active coins over
on [Capitoday](https://capitoday.com), much thanks to @3ninos efforts building
our presence on their platform. (Right now we're listed as number 7 top
community, and the number 1 boosted coin 😎)

This past Thursday marked our first appearance on their newly launched shill
spaces. Day went on and gave a quick rundown on what Hege is all about, how
we're creating a multi-cycle brand through art and storytelling, and how we're
building the community to make it all happen.

Big thanks to [@Capitoday](https://x.com/capitoday) for having us,
and shoutouts to [Madame Web (@nattacini)](https://x.com/nattacini) for hosting the space!

We'd love to come back on next time, there's so much more to talk about!

## Coming Up Ahead

In other news, Day got a little bit carried away on our website remaster. He
spent the week neck deep in the weeds optimizing it to the limit, obsessing over
fetch priorities, cache lifetimes, and critical rendering paths. True nerd! 🤓 A
preview has already been released in our Telegram, and the final version will go
live this week.
