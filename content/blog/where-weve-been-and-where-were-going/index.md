"If there will be a survivor in the meme slaughter, it will be Hege. And what
happens when the whole competition is dead and you have been building for a
year?" Well guess what!

Well guess what. This message is from 8 months ago and while time passed we did,
in fact, build. And what better time to celebrate this than now, right before
the news that will "solidify us as a multi-cycle Brandcoin"?

So come along with me for a brief stroll down memory lane. Quick disclaimer
before we begin, this isn't EVERYTHING we've achieved so far, just some of my
all time faves. Here goes:

## IRL CAMPAIGNS 🗺️

The Hege Sticker Contest has a very special place in my heart. Easily one of the
most fun initiatives, and with the most participation from the community. The
police car was an insane addition to the collection lol. Oh and thank you for
the rewards!

Over four weekends, 10,000 HEGE sponsored maps were handed out on the Vegas
strip, putting our art, story, and brand directly into people’s hands. Hege has
partnered with a well established advertisement company in Las Vegas to hand out
Hege branded maps.

At the heart of every meme coin that evolves into a true Brand is a global
community, growth strategy, and standout art. Hege has it all, and we've proved
it time and time again. In this collab with The Art Cartel, Hege took over the
streets. Four weeks, ten locations, 9 countries and a grand finale in Times
Square. Our very own Mr. Worldwide!

## NFTs, UTILITY and REWARDS 💸💸💸

{{< yt-embed

>}}

This was just insane. 2,222 hand-drawn Hegends, ~$100 each at launch, sold out
in like an hour. This was a huge success and helped kick-start our marketing
budget, but what caused the NFTs to sell this fast? Easy. REAL utility. Buybacks
and rewards. Here's how it works:

### NFT Bank

- When the Hegends were minted (purchased at launch), a portion of the minting fees was deposited into a special NFT bank
- This NFT bank is used to perform buybacks, driving up the price of $HEGE

### Monthly distributions

- Each month, 5% of the Hege tokens in the bank are distributed among NFT holders
- The distribution is proportional: if you hold more NFTs, you receive more tokens

### Rarity tiers & multipliers

- The NFTs are categorized into 5 rarity tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary
- Depending on tier, the multiplier of rewards is different:
  1. Common: 1.0×
  1. Uncommon: 1.5×
  1. Rare: 2.5×
  1. Epic: 5.0×
  1. Legendary: 10.0×

### Royalties / transactions

- When an NFT is bought or sold, an 8% royalty is applied
- Of that 8%, half goes to the project wallet, and half goes into the NFT bank (which helps fund future token purchases and thus future rewards)

### Eligibility / constraints

- NFTs that are listed for sale on the distribution date are not eligible for the rewards. So you can’t have your NFT on sale in the marketplace during that snapshot / distribution period
- The wallet that holds the NFT must also hold at least 100 HEGE tokens

## MERCH MERCH MERCH! 🧢

The Hege merchandise store, powered by PlantFaceAsh (just like the murals and
our DRiP). Lots of fun initiatives involving the new merch, some of them hosted
by members of the community, like the #hegetotoe contest (post a sick photo with
your new-new on, win your order's full cash-back) and the Hege Trivia show.
Thanks to J K and RJ Mac!

### A PHILANTROPIC HEGE 🖍️

{{< figure

Speaking of DRiP, back in November 2024 Hege launched its official channel on
drip.haus, the pioneering NFT artwork platform, dropping exclusive artwork that
quickly made an impact in the DRiP community. This has become a key piece of
Hege’s footprint in the NFT scene, and an outlet for our artists to have freedom
of expression with more experimental pieces for the DRiP community to collect.

Our DRiP group recently donated 1M droplets to Sunshine Pledge to go towards
installing solar panels in an orphanage in South East Asia. We also donated 150k
droplets to School of NFT to sponsor another HegeCoin Meals Session and digital
tools for a school in Malaysia!

Thanks to Hege's impact on their platform, DRiP officially added Hege to its
treasury assets in January 2025, recognizing us as a long-term cultural coin
(the same DRiP that's just been acquired by Jupiter!) A major nod to the
project's staying power.

## PUBLICITY STUNTS 🛩️

Probably an all time favourite at the Hegequarters. You can see why.

## MULTI. CYCLE. BRAND. COIN.

If you've made it this far in the post, thank you. This is genuinely just a TINY
fraction of what we've accomplished so far as a project, and a brand. But what
now?

The team has been cooking up a storm behind the scenes that will stir the meme
space well into Q1 2026. Big changes are coming to the Hege fund, all of them
aimed at engraving 4 simple words in the mind of the market.

You really don't want to miss the next real announcements from the team, some
stuff will be revealed shortly and a lot more in these next few months, during
what is supposed to be peak altseason. Hege is here to stay and lead the charge.
