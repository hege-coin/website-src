As the crypto market struggled to regain its footing after last week's flash
crash, Hege dropped a fresh DRiP snapshot, and made a debut on mattle.fun. Welcome
to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of October 13 – 19, 2025_**

It's Sunday again, Hegends. And you know what that means: time to have a look at
what went down in Hege land during the week.

First off, on Tuesday Day was back with a new live chart session for all you TA
geeks in the community. Check out the [replay here](https://youtu.be/J0_Tk1akGFw).

Then on Friday this week again [Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83) hosted a
banger The HEGE Experience X space. This time we got to hear all about what
up-and-coming [mattle.fun](https://x.com/mattlefun) is cooking up in the web3
gaming world. [Give the replay a
listen](https://x.com/deftony83/status/1979233176087117831) if you missed it!

Moving on, the two big items in Hege this week were:

1. A new Hege DRiP snapshot, and
2. Hege joining Mattle.fun.

More on those after the market update below.

Let's go!

## Crypto markets struggled to regain their footing

Looking first to the markets, this week saw the aftermath of last week's flash
crash play out. Early in the week, markets bounced back somewhat. However, as
the week went on, bitcoin and altcoins alike struggled to regain their footing,
as dip-buyers took profits.

In tradfi, stock market pulled back a little, which also didn't help crypto. And
looking to bitcoin ETF flows, the week saw substantial outflows. For bitcoin to
turn around back up again, we need to see those ETF flows turn positive again.

Chart-wise, the week has not closed yet, but it looks like bitcoin will close
the week below the $109k level that has held as support all the way back since
early July. Though we'll have to wait until tomorrow to see exactly where it
closes.

All that said, ending on a positive note it's still too early to call the cycle
top. Like we had a fake-out to the upside the other week, this could turn into a
fake-down in the opposite direction. From a pure chart perspective, despite the
recent weakness, the inverse head & shoulders breakout is still in play in the
bitcoin chart. Meaning the price target remains at $142k. Also, price is still
holding above the 40 week EMA, meaning the trend is still up.

Usually cooler heads prevail, so let's wait and see how the coming week plays
out.

## Hege ❤️ Mattle.fun

Moving on, the DRiP snapshot wasn't the only collab this week.

Because as of Tuesday, there is a new fighter in the game on Mattle.fun. Yup, that's
right. Hege has entered the Mattle arena!

Mattle.fun is a new survival-style hypercasual web3 game with a defi twist. By
trading partnered tokens on their DEX, you can boost your game character's
traits to gain advantage in the game and climb the leader board. Trading $HEGE
will increase your character's in-game luck.

Sounds confusing? The easiest way to understand it is to just jump in the game
and try it out.
