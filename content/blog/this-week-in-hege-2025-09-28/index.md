As fear gripped the crypto market and traders got liquidated left and right,
Hege BuyBot made an entrance in Hegequarters, and a fresh snapshot dropped on
DRiP. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of September 22 – 28_**

Let's be honest here, it's been a pretty shit week in the crypto markets. On
the one hand that sucks, but on the other there's nothing much we can do about
it. Weeks like these we try not to get too caught up in the daily drama of the
markets, and just put our heads down and keep building. That's what's gonna 
matter in the long run anyway.

The two big things to happen in Hege this week were the new Hege BuyBot being
released in Hegequarters, and the "Heavy Truths" snapshot dropping on DRiP.

Let's jump in!

## Crypto leverage flushout?

In the tradfi world, not much happened this week. Midweek, US GDP and jobs
numbers came in a little bit better than expected, causing the market to
slightly pare back expectations of rate cuts. On Friday, PCE inflation came in
as expected. And looking to the charts, US stock indices remain strong, with no
signs of tops being in.

In crypto however, this week was a different story. On Monday morning, bitcoin
started selling off heavily, and the rest of the crypto market followed right
behind. The sell-off then continued throughout the week, before BTC stabilized
around $109k on Friday. Total liquidations reached billions of dollar, as short
term traders got wiped out of their positions.

On the weekly timeframe, however, the charts for bitcoin and the big alts still
hold above key support levels. Although it is a sign of weakness that BTC is
retesting $109k support again so soon, the breakout is still in play, and the
price target of $142k remains.

So, what to make of all this? Well, let's consider the situation:

* Crypto aggressively sold off across the board, but larger picture it still looks okay.
* Tradfi markets held up, not showing any particular signs of fear.

These two facts make this dump look like a temporary correction, cause by market
makers flushing out leveraged positions.

If this assessment is correct, crypto markets should turn up again within the next couple
of weeks. So let's keep watching.

## Hege BuyBot, reporting for duty

As planned, on Tuesday the new Hege BuyBot made its entrance into Hegequarters.

This bot is 100% custom made in-house, just for Hege. This means we can easily
add new features that have not been available to us with any of the other bots
we've used in the past. 

Starting out, custom animations for buys of various sizes are back. The old
easter eggs for $69 and $420 are back too, of course. Plus a new one has been
added (hint: it miiight have something to do with a popular sports car brand
that shall not be named.)

## Coming up ahead

First off, we're cooking up a little competition to celebrate the new buy bot.
It's not quite ready for serving yet, but expect an announcement towards the end
of the week.

Second, we're getting ready to announce the big changes that have been brewing
behind the scenes over the past weeks and months even. We've hinted at this in
the past already, and now we're finally close to making some actual
announcements. Stay tuned!
