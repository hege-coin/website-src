As December darkness descends over the northern hemisphere, cozy up for a
Hege Royale duke-out, and sip on the latest DRiP set. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**For the week of December 1–7, 2025**

GM Hegends!

It's December already fam, holidays fast approaching. Are we gonna get that
long-awaited gift of retail engagement from Crypto Santa this year? Probably not.
He's forgotten all about us. Which honestly isn't too surprising, given how
exceptionally bad the crypto grifters in charge have behaved this year.

But anyway, retail darkness notwithstanding, Hege remains dead set on spreading
the light, and this Sunday is no different.

Check out the latest [TA Tuesday](https://youtu.be/kkOHJdhzHXU) for a look at
the markets. Then read on about the new Hege multiplayer game, and enjoy the
latest set of art dropped on DRiP.

Let's go!

## Rate cut, incoming!

On Wednesday the Fed's FOMC, chaired by head-hog Powell, is expected to cut
rates another 25 basis points, bringing the target rate down to 3.5-3.75%. This
is generally considered bullish for risk assets like stocks and crypto.

Stocks were slightly up on the week, making a continued rally into the end of
the year seem likely.

Meanwhile, crypto ended the week flat, the bounce selling off again. Like we've
been saying over the past two weeks now, this is what we expect is going to keep
happen. The bitcoin breakdown dealt heavy technical damage to the chart, and
that's probably going to take time to repair. No matter what influencers on X
would like to have you believe.

We'll keep monitoring the charts every week of course for signs of a bottom
being in, but we do have to be prepared for it to take time.

## Hegena & the Boy Who Wouldn’t Quit

Last week we wrote about the new DRiP snapshot that was taking place.

Now the snapshot has ended, and you can go have a look at the pieces in the
collection. So what are you waiting for?? Head over to Hege DRiP and see the 
latest narrative unfold.

Thanks to Ash and Chris for organizing our DRiP, and to Elena for the artwork!

## Coming up ahead

Last week we wrote that the new Merch Store was going to launch this week.
Unfortunately there was an incident. As it happens, a marmot family of four
sneaked into Hege's backback on his recent autumn hike. Undiscovered, the little
rascals managed to hitch a ride all the way back to the headquarters, where
they promptly set up camp in the server rack's power unit. A wild marmot hunt
ensued, but luckily, after a frantic couple of days, we are now happy to
announce that the furry family has been relocated to more proper winter dwellings. After
this successful de-marmoting of the Merch Store, we are on track for a new
launch attempt this week. Stay tuned. (Totally true story!)

In the charts department, barring and further rodent incidents, tune in to TA
Tuesday live in [Hegequarters](https://t.me/Hegequarters), on Tuesday, December
9, at 17:00 UTC. It will also be livestreamed on YouTube.
