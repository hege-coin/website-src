**_This week in $HEGE, for the week of June 16 – June 22, 2025._**

Hello Hegends! It’s time for another weekly update from your favorite team. This
week again, markets have been on the edge of their seats trying to make sense of
what’s happening in the Middle East. Lots of uncertainty. Lots of fear. On our
end, we try to ignore all of that most of the time, because it’s way beyond our
power to control. Instead, we put all our focus on building and delivering. And
this week, delivered we have!

Let’s dive in.

## Market update

We’ll start with a short market update.

Of course the big thing this week again has been the escalating attacks between
Israel and Iran. And this morning we learned that the US has now entered the
conflict as well. The added uncertainty and fear has caused the markets to sell
off across the board, with the altcoin market being hit especially hard.

We’re not going to try to predict what will happen next or how long this will
drag on for. The geopolitical machinations at play here are way beyond our
humble hedgehog brains to comprehend. It could blow over fast, it could drag on.
We’ll just have to sit tight and see.

While all eyes have been on the Middle East, a few positive things of note have
happened during the week as well.

On Tuesday, June 17, with support from both parties, the US Senate passed their
GENIUS Act. Passing this bill moves the US one step closer to a solid regulation
of stablecoins, and it’s a big win for crypto. It now has to be passed by the
House to go into law. There has been some pushback about the bill not offering
enough protection against corruption. But Trump is pushing for it to get passed,
and meanwhile Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has been out bullposting about
stablecoins on X. It seems likely it will be passed within the coming months.

On Wednesday, the US Fed decided to keep the interest rate unchanged. This was
expected by the markets, and did not have much of an impact. Chairman Powell is
warning that Trump’s tariffs will increase inflation in the coming months. This
makes them want to avoid cutting rates too soon. Nonetheless, they still project
two rate cuts this year, as before. ll in all, what the Fed does right now has
little impact on the markets, compared to everything else that’s going on.

Meanwhile, inflows to the bitcoin and ethereum ETFs continue to be strong. In
addition, Strategy bagged another $1 billion worth of BTC, and it seems almost
every day there is news about other companies announcing their own plans to
either start buying crypto, or to buy more of it. Companies buying crypto is
clearly becoming one of the key narratives this cycle. In our view, this is very
bullish.

## Up ahead in the coming week

All focus the coming week will be on the Hege Merch Store of course. You can all
help out by spreading the word in any way you can think of!

With all going on with the merch, we didn’t get to announce the winners in the
Disasterpiece contest. Sorry about that! We haven’t forgotten about it and we’ll
do our best to get it done this week. We might also have another small surprise
launch in store. Stay tuned!

## Thanks for reading!

That marks the end of this week’s update. Thanks for reading and thanks for
being a part of the community and helping to write the Hege story. We hope the
turmoil in the markets and in the world will calm down in the weeks to come. But
regardless of what will happen next, we will keep building. That’s for sure!
