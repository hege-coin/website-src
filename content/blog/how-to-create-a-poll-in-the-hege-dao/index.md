*This post is part of a series of posts about the Hege DAO, see [How To Use the
Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao/) for an introduction and overview.*

## How to create a poll

**NOTE: To create a poll, you must first be a member of the Hege DAO. If
you are not already a member, please follow the instructions in [How to Become a
Member of the Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-become-a-member-of-the-hege-dao/), and then
come back here.**

This article will show how to create a **poll proposal** for getting the opinion
from member in the Hege DAO.  (If you want to make a spending proposal to spend
funds from the DAO treasury, see [How to Create a Spending
Request](/blog/how-to-create-a-spending-request-in-the-hege-dao/) instead.)

## When you are a member of the Hege DAO, here is how to create a poll proposal

1. Go to the [Hege DAO page on
Realms](https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy).
Connect your wallet. It should look something like this. You can see how many
$HEGE tokens you have deposited in the upper right corner, right next to the
banner. *(NOTE: You must have at least 10,000 $HEGE deposited to make a
proposal. See [How to Deposit and
Withdraw](/blog/how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-hege-from-the-hege-dao/) to learn
how to deposit tokens.)*
