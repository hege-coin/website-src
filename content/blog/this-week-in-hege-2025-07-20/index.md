As bitcoin confirmed its breakout and the US passed landmark crypto legislation,
Hege started the July marketing campaign by setting off a sticker contest,
dropping a big set of dope summer merch, and more. Welcome to this week in Hege!

**_For the week of July 14 – July 20_**

Soo many things going on this week we can barely keep track. While bitcoin
confirmed its breakout and the US House passed stablecoin regulation, Hege
dropped a big set of fresh summer Merch, set off a new sticker contest, and
PixelGlowMagic announced the beta version of his Hege Mania game.

And that’s just the things we have space to cover this week. Beyond that we also
ran a raiding competition all week, and kicked off our [Vegas
campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1m0lagf/advertising_at_las_vegas_going_smoothly_you_love/).
Then Ollie wrote [a banger press

and we were mentioned by [Frenchie World on their 900,000+ followers
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/frenchie.world/3678257141911840304).

## Bitcoin breakout, “Crypto Week” in the House

In the markets, this week it finally happened! BTC closed last week at 119k and
confirmed the breakout we have all been waiting for. After this move, the
conservative price target becomes 142k. On the back of a building corporate
buying frenzy, there’s a good chance it will eventually go even higher, but 142k
is the price target for now.

On Thursday, the US House passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and on Friday it
was signed into law by the President. The bill passed with 308 votes to 122,
meaning many Democrats also voted for it. This shows there is broad support for
crypto in both parties, which is great news for future legislation.

After having spent this week consolidating after the breakout, next up we’re
looking for BTC to resume the rally in the week to come. Let’s see!
