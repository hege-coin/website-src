## What is the League of Hegends?

From day one, Hege has been a community effort — without our community, we
simply wouldn’t exist. The League of Hegends will be our way of showing respect
to those members of our community who time after time have shown selfless
dedication to the Hege vision. The ones who refused to give up when others
doubted. The ones who kept supporting, building, raiding, entertaining. The real
Hegends.

Starting out with three Hegends, over time the Hege team will keep selecting new
members into the league, creating an ever-growing digital monument to honor all
the amazing people who made Hege possible.

Concretely, the League of Hegends is a new space on the Hege website. On this
page, each person who has been selected into the league is displayed with an
artwork, custom-made just for them, along with the reasoning for why they were
picked.

Over time, more and more members will be added to the league, making it bigger
and bigger. There will not be a fixed schedule as to when we will add new
Hegends, but to get a rough idea, expect a new introduction every few weeks.

## How do we pick Hegends for the League?

All Hegends added to the League will be chosen by the team. We decided to do it
this way for two reasons:

1. It’s not always obvious which community members are the ones who make big contributions. Sometimes it’s very clear, for example if somebody is very active raiding, and chatting in the Hegequarters all the time. But sometimes there’s a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes that is crucial to the success of the project, but that’s not so visible to those looking in from the outside. Because of this, only the team is in the position to make this judgment fairly.
2. Having community members vote on new picks introduces a whole host of issues around gaming votes. And we want the real contributors, not the ones who were best at manipulating our voting system. In the future this might be possible to solve, but right now it’s unfortunately not.

So with this in mind, we decided the best choice is to let the team decide for
now, while being as transparent as possible about our reasoning.

If you want to nominate a person that you think we should pick, there is a form
on the League of Hegends page where you can submit a nomination. Click “What’s
this?” under the big artwork at the top of the page. A popup will open, and
there will be a button there to open a form. You can also just write to us on
Telegram, X, or any other social channel.

## Final words

Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank every Hegend for being with
us this far. Whether you're an OG or joined us last week, we appreciate the work
you are able to put in. And remember: the work you put in will reward you a
hundred-fold. The more people we have working, the more we'll all be rewarded —
win-win.

So thank you again for joining the Hege community. We hope you've found a good
home here!
