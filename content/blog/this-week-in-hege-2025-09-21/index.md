Rate cuts are here! Meanwhile the Hege’s Multiverse snapshot finished on DRiP, as rumors of a new Hege Telegram buybot made their way into the Hegequarters. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of September 15 — 21_**

Gm Hegends and hope you all had a great weekend! This week Day (who writes these updates every week) has been busy cooking up a new buybot for our Hegequarters Telegram channel. So the update for this week is going to be a bit shorter than usual.

The main news this week is that our latest DRiP snapshot was finished (more on that below). And as usual we held a Hege Hangouts on Friday (go check out the recording if you missed it!)

Let’s jump in.

## Rate cuts have finally arrived

And so September 17 finally came. The day that we’ve been writing about now for months it feels like; the day of the long awaited rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. All eyes were on the announcement from the Fed, and on chairman Powell’s subsequent press conference.

As expected, the Fed decided to cut 25 basis points, bringing the target rate down from 4.25-4.50% to 4.0-4.25%. On the press conference Powell explained how in their view the risk factors have balanced over the past 6 months, from inflation being the overwhelming risk, to a weakening jobs market and higher unemployment now also becoming a concern. In the Fed’s view, this warrants a rate cut, and also most likely more cuts going forward.

The narrative of rate cuts = bullish still holds, as the US stock markets overall reacted positively to the news, closing the week at all time highs. The charts look very strong, with no signs of a top being in.

On the crypto side, bitcoin is lagging a little bit behind, still working on breaking through resistance around 117k. But the chart still looks good, and it’s likely only a matter of time before it breaks through, and moves on to new all time highs, possibly some time in October. The price target on the weekly chart remains at 142k.

Bitcoin dominance ended the week where it started, still clearly trending down — altseason is still developing.

All in all, no reason for concern here.
