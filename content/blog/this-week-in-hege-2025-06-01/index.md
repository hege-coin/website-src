## $HEGE Trending on Cryptotwits, again!

Hege had a stellar week on Cryptotwits this week again. With the help of all of
you in the Hege community we achieved some pretty impressive results:

- $HEGE appeared in the top 10 trending list for 5 days in a row.
- Posts were retweeted by Cryptotwits’ official account, reaching over 75k views.
- $HEGE received a shoutout in one of Cryptotwits’ market updates (another 25k views).
- Numerous posts and memes reshared by their official accounts.
- We gained 200+ new watchlist followers.

Big up to everybody who helped out to get traction, you really made a
difference. Keep it coming! And if you haven’t posted there yet, get on it ASAP.

After seeing such a good response, we actually decided to up the bounties on our
Cryptotwits competition. Instead of just 10,000 $HEGE for a single winner, we
increased it to 15,000 for the winner, plus 5,000 each for two runner ups.

The competition just concluded, and the winners were selected. Congratulations
to Shaan_M9 for the win, and BigDawg296 and Rjmac12000 for the runner-up prizes!

## $HEGE in Vegas

This week saw The Bitcoin Conference 2025 go down in Las Vegas. This conference
is the largest Bitcoin conference in the world, and this year it drew 35,000
peope to hang out, network, and listen to the top though leaders in the crypto
space. And of course we were there with a street team to rep $HEGE to all the
attendees.

## What’s coming up in the week ahead? Bifinance listing and the new merch store

On Monday, June 2nd (yes, that’s tomorrow!), we have an announcement about the
upcoming Bifinance listing. That’s all we can say for now. Stay tuned to our
Telegram to catch the news!

Our new merch store is coming along nicely. We had initially hoped we could
release it this weekend, but we need one more week to make sure it’s really
primed. Sorry about that. But we don’t want to rush it and put something
half-assed out there. That’s just not our style. And it’s only one more week, so
please bear with us. It’ll be worth the wait!

## Oh, and Lewk has reset for the month of June. Don’t forget to vote!

The Hegequarters strategically saved its votes for an early lead. Now we need to
hold the line and show the world we’re the most active memecoin community.

Remember to get your daily votes in and include it in your daily routine. All
the little things we do add up and get $HEGE to the eyes of more investors.

## Thanks for reading!

Well that’s it for this week. Thanks for reading, and most of all thanks
everybody for supporting the team and making the Hege community such a great
place!

*— Team Hege*

PS. If you’re not in our Telegram already, what are you waiting for!? It’s THE
place to hang out, have fun, and keep up with what’s going on.
