Bear markets are for building, which is exactly what our boy Hege has been up
to. Rep by rep. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

*For the week of February 2–8, 2026.*

## GM Hegends!

Hope you're all still hanging in there! (Just kidding, of course you are fam!)

But there's no denying that the market has been brutal. Bitcoin sliced down
through 70k support like it wasn't even there, and the bear market is now
clearly here. What this means for a smallcap like us is hard to say. Altcoins
didn't top on euphoria this time, so maybe the worst is already past us. I don't
know. But what I do know is this: we're not going anywhere.

Bear markets are for building. Which is exactly what our boy Hege has been up
to.

Let's dive in!
