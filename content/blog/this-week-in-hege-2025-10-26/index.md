While crypto markets stabilized, Hege steamed on, launching the Hege DAO, and
taking a spot on the exclusive day 1 release of the PSG1 with Hege Dash. Welcome
to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of October 20 – 26, 2025_**

GM Hegends. This is Day at the keyboard, coming in to you from a rainy Sunday
morning here in Sweden. A perfect time to sit down and go through all that went
down in Hege this week. 

Jumping straight into it, the two big items we'll cover this week are 1) Hege
Dash launching on the Play Solana PSG1 console from day one, and 2) the launch
of the Hege DAO. Read on below the market update for a deeper dive into those!

Aside from these two main items, a bunch of other things happened this week too. Here
they are in a short list for you to check out on your own:

- Day did the usual TA Tuesday for all you fellow chart geeks. [Replay here](https://youtu.be/SF4fA55LKFQ).
- [Charlie](https://x.com/deftony83) hosted another HEGE Experience X space on Friday. This one was all about the Hege DAO, Hege Dash, and more. [Give the replay a listen](https://x.com/deftony83/status/1980978279625773472) if you missed it!
- "B&W October" snapshot dropped on DRiP. [Announcement tweet here](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1981335088634982874).
- [AMA on r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1of4l3f/ama_welcome_to_hegecoins_third_time_back_at_rcc/).

Let's dive in!

## Crypto markets stabilized this week

As always, let's start with a short look at what the markets did this week.

Big picture first: in tradfi, US stock markets had a good week. The fearful
sentiment after the recent dip is waning, as both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq
closed at new weekly all time highs.

The US government shutdown is still leaving the markets flying somewhat blind,
as it's causing much of the usual economic data to not be released. However, on
Friday the latest CPI numbers did come out, and they came out slightly lower
than expected. This was welcomed by the markets, as it removed any doubts of
further Fed rate cuts.

Turning to crypto, last Sunday it looked like bitcoin would close the week below
$109k support. Losing this level, which has held all the way since the July
breakout, would have made the chart look weaker. But as it turns out, later on
Sunday evening bitcoin bounced back, and ended up closing last week right at
$109k support. Holding this weekly support made the chart look a lot better than
it would have otherwise.

Last week we mentioned that the bitcoin ETFs had a week of outflows after the
flash crash, and that we need to see those turn into inflows again for bitcoin
to turn around. And that's exactly what they did this week. A total of 4k BTC,
the inflows were not large, but it shows that institutions remain positive, not
turning away from crypto in fear.

The week has not closed yet, but it looks like bitcoin will comfortably close
above $109k yet another week. Holding this support, in combination with strong
stock markets, and ETF flows turning positive again, sets up a good base for the
possibility of a renewed rally into the end of the year. Meanwhile, the
conservative price target at $142k remains.

## Hello, Hege DAO!

Moving on, we're finally ready to give you all in the Hege community a more
direct voice in the project. From decisions shaping the future of Hege, to how
treasury funds are used for marketing and community events, the Hege DAO is a
first step on the road to giving more power to the community.

In simple terms, you can think of the Hege DAO as a treasury wallet that is
fully owned by the Hege community. The DAO members all come together to decide
how funds are spent from this wallet.

To become a member you go to the DAO website, where you deposit some $HEGE
tokens to prove that you are a stakeholder in the project. You can then vote on
proposals, and even create your own proposals to request funding for your idea.

Head over to the Hege Blog for detailed instructions on how to join the DAO,
vote, and make proposals!
