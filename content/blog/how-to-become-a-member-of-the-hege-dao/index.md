Become a member of the Hege DAO to get a direct voice in the future of Hege. If
you deposit $HEGE tokens, you can vote on how project funding is spent, and also
submit your own requests for funding.

*This post is part of a series of posts about the Hege DAO, see [How To Use the
Hege DAO](/blog/how-to-use-the-hege-dao/) for an introduction and overview.*

## Become a member of the Hege DAO

To vote on proposals, and to create your own proposals, you must become a member of
the Hege DAO.

You become a member of the Hege DAO by depositing $HEGE tokens into it.

Under the hood, the Hege DAO is hosted on the Realms platform. This is a
user-friendly interface to the Solana on-chain SPL Governance program. This
system has been audited, and is trusted by the biggest names in the Solana
ecosystem, like Jito, Metaplex, Pyth, Bonk, and many more.

Depositing $HEGE into the DAO is free of charge, and the deposited tokens can be
withdrawn at any time. 

For your first deposit into the Hege DAO, you are going to use the old version
of the Realms UI. Why is that? It's because in their new UI, they charge 0.1 SOL
for your initial deposit. But you can get around that by using the old one,
where deposits are free. After your first deposit, you can then use the new UI
with no extra costs.

## How to make your first deposit 

1. Go to the [Realms legacy app](https://app.realms.today/). It should look like this:

7. Select how much $HEGE to deposit and click "Confirm". (NOTE: You need to
deposit at least 10,000 $HEGE to be able to create a proposal, should you want
to.)
