As people were busy stuffing themselves with turkey and hunting for Black Friday
bargains, Hege dropped a new snapshot on DRiP. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of November 24–30, 2025_**

Aaand another week has passed. This is Thanksgiving weekend for our American
fam, so a Happy belated Thanksgiving to all of you Hegends, wherever you are in
the world!

In Hege land, on Tuesday Day held his usual TA session. Go check out [the
replay](https://youtu.be/aSEdv1gKyH0) if you didn't catch it.

And on Friday, [Charlie X](https://x.com/deftony83) hosted the weekly HEGE
Experience X space, with a recap of what's been going on in Hege over the past
month, and what's to come ahead. The replay is [available
here](https://x.com/deftony83/status/1994451077735838088) ($HEGE alpha was
shared!)

And last but not least, a new snapshot is live on Hegecoin DRiP! Read more about
that below the market update.

Let's goooo.

## To bounce, or not to bounce?

In the markets, everything bounced this week.

Last week, after the lackluster response to Nvidias strong earnings, we thought
stock markets might be in for a correction over the next month or two. That is
much less certain now. The market bounced back strongly this week already, and
it seems dip buyers stepped in earlier than expected. This could lead to a
renewed rally into the end of the year.

Bitcoin followed the stock market up, continuing the bounce from the low around
$81k. If tech stocks keep rallying, it could well continue higher. However,
remember that unlike tech stocks, bitcoin properly broke down the week before
last, so technically it looks much much weaker.

The unfortunate truth is that crypto is failing to get much attention right now
compared to AI. After the breakdown in bitcoin, we should expect there to be a
lot of people still looking to de-risk their crypto holdings. So until there are
clear signs of a bottom being in, any pump should be viewed with suspicion.

Trading bounces and shorter term rallies can be very profitable, even in bear
markets. But remember to stay cautious, and always $HEGE your bets.
