## Bitcoin bulls and bears are battling it out in the markets

Stock markets have been strong this week, with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq
100 at new all time highs. Can’t argue with that, extremely bullish.

Meanwhile in crypto, bitcoin bulls and bears have been battling it out over the
$109-110k level. On Thursday, bulls had a go at breaking out, but they couldn’t
quite make it. It’s not surprising to see resistance around the prior all time
highs. But the chart looks very strong, and with all the positive news lately,we
think a breakout is the most likely scenario.

Bitcoin is the one to watch here, because whatever it does now will set the tone
for the rest of the year. If it fails to break out, altcoins will struggle. But
if it does break out, altcoins will likely be on fire towards the end of the
year. As said, we think a breakout is the most likely scenario, so we remain
cautiously optimistic.

Our resident TA geek @itsdayagain shares this weekly BTC chart. He says we want to see a strong weekly breakout candle to complete the current consolidation period and move on to the next leg up. Looking back, this pattern of consolidation followed by a breakout has repeated 4 times since the bottom in 2022. Odds are it will repeat for a 5th time.

## Introducing the Hege Blog

Moving on to Hege news: on Wednesday, the Hege website got a new section: the
**Hege Blog**!

We’ve been secretly cooking this up over the past couple of weeks, and now it's
ready for you to see! 

The Hege Blog will be a place for us to post weekly project updates, awesome
artwork, competition announcements, and other things like that. With our own
blog, we can publish things outside of social media, and it will be a great tool
for us to reach more people!
