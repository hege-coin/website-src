As stock markets reached new highs and bitcoin rallied, the winners in the Hege
Sticker Contest were announced, and the League of Hegends got a new member.
Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of September 8—14_**

Hey guys, it’s Sunday and time for a fresh update from your favorite team!

There were lots of things going on this week. In today’s edition we’ll cover the
results of the Hege summer sticker contest, and the new Hegend that was welcomed
into to the League of Hegends.

In addition to this, we also released a new DRiP snapshot: [Hege’s
Multiverse](https://drip.haus/hegecoin/set/aa57151c-7761-46ec-a78c-bcf1c267e084).
So make sure to go check that out! And also of course we held the weekly Hege
Hangouts on Friday as usual. Go [watch the
recording](https://youtu.be/GpLgMhE3nXs) in case you missed it!

Let’s jump in.

## Bitcoin continued to bounce, as stock markets put in new ATHs

As always, let’s start with a look at what’s been going on in the markets.

This week, macro was all focused on the latest inflation numbers coming in from
the US. As the dominating narrative goes, job numbers being somewhat weak is
good news, because that will cause the Fed to cut rates. But the one thing that
could mess this up would be inflation heating up again. Then we’d get the
dreaded combination of a slowing economy paired with increasing inflation, also
known as stagflation, which is every central banker’s worst nightmare.

But luckily, the inflation data this week came in okay. Markets were happy,
putting in new all time highs. So everything is good for now, the party goes on!

Next up all eyes will be on the FOMC rate cut announcement on Wednesday, and
especially on chairman Powell’s comments on the path ahead for the rest of the
year.

Turning to crypto and the bitcoin chart, it looks good too. Two weeks ago, when
bitcoin was dipping down to $109k, we had this to say: “Going back to test the
level of a breakout like this is not uncommon, and it’s usually the logical
place to buy the dip.” This turned out to be the right call, as bitcoin had
another good week this week, continuing the bounce from last week.

As for bitcoin dominance, it’s still dropping. Meaning altseason is still on.
The altcoin gains so far have mostly been contained to the big players, like
Ethereum, Solana, and BNB. As altseason progresses and retail wakes up, the
rally will likely spread to smaller cap coins (like Hege). Let’s keep watching!

## Sticker Contest winners are IN!

Turning to Hege, our summer sticker contest has concluded, and the winners have
been selected. Big thanks to all who participated and helped spread the Hege
love around the world! And thanks also to Nick and Ollie for organizing the
competition.

Here are all the winners:

Greatest Overall View ($100)

**‍🏛 @fr33nino at the Colosseum, Rome 🏛**

Technically taken just before the contest launched, but honestly… nothing else
even came close to this view 😍

Most Controversial Placement ($100)

**‍🚨 @Flo0o0o0oooOooOoO0 — Brussels police car 🚨**

Definitely the boldest move of the contest, risking prison time or a fine of up
to 500€.

Most QR Code Scans ($50)‍

**🌞 @LarCal80 — Ft. Lauderdale & Miami 🌞**

This one’s partly detective work: a spike of unrecognized scans lined up
perfectly with his sticker drops, and the USA ended up being the clear scanning
champion overall.

**👏 Runners-Up ($25 each) 👏**

‍These hegends put in serious work stickering and keeping older spots alive:

## Welcome to the League of Hegends 3nino!

Moving on, this week we introduced our next entry to the [League of
Hegends](/league-of-hegends/)...  @fr33nino!

3nino is working man by night and a Hegend at day, driven by a mission to slap
stickers throughout the home of the Romans. He's been here as long as hedgehogs
have existed (well, we think) and no matter what the market looks like, keeps
his spikes out.

Dependable, bullish, and hard-working, he does as the Romans did — dominates.

Check out his page here: [hegecoin.com/league-of-hegends/3nino](/league-of-hegends/3nino)

Also thanks to JB for the text, and [Pondy](https://x.com/Ponderman_NFT) for the artwork!

## Coming up ahead

Altseason is starting to heat up, and we are ramping up our efforts along with
it. Right now we especially have some nice things cooking in the artwork and
animation department, so stay tuned for that going forward.
