As markets were occupied with the latest Nvidia earnings and inflation numbers,
a fresh Hege snapshot was launched on DRiP, and Hege Dash is being ported to the
new Play Solana gaming console. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of August 25—31_**

And so another week is over. This week in macro was all about Nvidia and the AI
story (still going strong) and the latest inflation numbers (came in okay). But
of course a bunch of things happened in Hege too.

First off, community member “se” made [an awesome
animation](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1961090541564923926) for the
#BoostMeCMC CoinMarketCap competition. The competition ended on Friday, and the
winner will be announced tomorrow (Monday, September 1st). Regardless of whether
Hege ends up winning or not, this was a great initiative. So big thanks for your
contribution, se!

Then, a new DRiP snapshot was announced, and we also got some news on the game
development front. Read more on those down below the market update!

Let's jump in.

## Bitcoin is testing the breakout level, while the AI train is chugging along

In the crypto markets, bitcoin pulled back during the week. But the breakout is
still in play, and altseason is still on.

The big thing in tradfi this week was the NVIDIA earnings report that came in on
Wednesday. They didn’t smash it out of the ballpark with this one, which
disappointed the markets a bit. But big picture the numbers were good — the
demand for chips is still strong, as the tech overlords keep building out data
centers to feed their LLM beasts. As I’ve said before, at some point the AI
train is going to run off the tracks and crash. But for now it’s still on,
chugging along just fine.

Zooming out a little, the issue of inflation and Fed rate cuts is still very
much front and center. Markets have been in somewhat of a stand-by mode over the
past couple of weeks, waiting for clarity. A rate cut at the September 17
meeting seems very likely; right now the market has it at 86% probability. But
the impact of tariffs on the economy and on prices is still not clear, and the
markets are left waiting for more signs before they decide which way to go.

This has also been reflected in bitcoin, which by now has spent 7 weeks
consolidating after the breakout in early July. The bitcoin chart this week is
more interesting than usual though, because it has come right down to test the
109k breakout level. Going back to test the level of a breakout like this is not
uncommon, and it’s usually the logical place to buy the dip. The week hasn’t
closed yet, but so far it looks like it will hold up.

The BTC price target of 142k still remains. Price has to fall down below 100k
before the breakout pattern (and price target) is invalidated. And so far we’re
nowhere near that level. That said, the chart will look better if we bounce
here.

Looking to the bitcoin dominance, there is no change since last week. It’s still
heading down, meaning altseason is still on.

All in all, there is no reason for concern yet. Let’s see what the coming week
brings!

## Hege Gaming Division update

We have some gaming news this week from Larva.

First off, Hege Dash has been successfully ported to the Solana Play PSG1! We’ve
received the source files, and submission for approval is underway.

The PSG1 is an upcoming retro Game Boy-style handheld gaming console focused on
Solana web3 games. It’s shipping early October, and they’ve sold 8,000
pre-orders already. If approved, Hege Dash will come preloaded on every console,
which would be huge exposure for the Hege brand!

Then there is also a brand new Hege game officially in the works! Featuring 10+
levels where you take control of Hege characters with a jetpack, this game is
being built for Android, iOS and the PSG1.

Special thanks to Larva for spearheading Hege game development. Stay tuned for
more!
