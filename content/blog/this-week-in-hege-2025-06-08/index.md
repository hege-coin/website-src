$HEGE listing on BiFinance officially announced, Reddit lighting up with
competition posts, merch store update, and more.

<!--more-->

**_For the week of June 2 – June 8, 2025._**

Yo Hegends! It’s Sunday again and I’m here to give you the rundown on what’s
been going on in Hege this week. Markets have been rough on us lately, but our
spirits are still high, and as usual there’s been lots of things going on. Let’s
take a closer look!

## $HEGE is coming to Bifinance on June 12th

The big news this week was the announcement of all the details of our upcoming
listing on the Bifinance exchange. Starting on June 12th, Bifinance users will
have access to trade $HEGE on their platform.

This adds one more exchange to our growing list of centralized exchanges. After
this listing, Hege will be available on 8 centralized exchanges: Bifinance,
Mexc, Bitmart, Lbank, Ascendex, Toobit, Bvox, and Indoex.

For now, we are happy with where we are on the exchange front. But of course
we’re always looking for new opportunities, and as our market cap grows, we will
continue to steadily climb the exhange ladder. One step at a time!

## The Reddit competition heats up

Starting off a little slow early in the week, momentum then picked up towards
the weekend with some great entries dropping in. Originally the deadline was
Friday, but we decided to extend it throughout the weekend. So there’s still a
little time left if you haven’t entered yet!

With the market being what it is lately, we know it’s not easy to get attention
on Reddit (or anywhere else for that matter!). But it’s still important that we
get out there and show we’re just as strong as ever. Even if people don’t take
action right now, they will know Hege exists, and they’ll subconsciously keep us
in the back of their minds. Then as the market picks up again and they are in a
more bullish mood, they will see us again, still going at it, and finally take
the plunge. That’s why we keep grinding, because we know it pays off in the end.

Big thanks to all who submitted posts already. Winners will be announced on
Tuesday, stay tuned!

## Coming up in the week ahead: Disasterpiece winners and Vegas photos

First off, we’ve started the process of picking out the winners for the Hege
Disasterpiece contest. A total of 50 pieces were submitted, and there were some
real gems in there. Hopefully we’ll have it all done during the week, and as
usual we’ll announce the winners on Telegram, X, and here on Reddit.

There should also be some fresh photos from the Vegas event last week for you
all to see. There were some pro photographers taking pictures at the event, and
now we’re waiting for them to send us the files. We’ll post them as soon as we
have them of course!

## Hege merch store update (it’s coming soon!!)

And lastly the big one we’re all waiting for: the new merch store. Ash has been
killing  it and it’s all coming together nicely. Nearly everything is in place,
and as soon as we have confirmed that the quality of the goods meets our
standards, we’re ready to go!

We’re even cooking up some special features for for NFT holders. And the best
part: 100% of the profits will go back into the project!
