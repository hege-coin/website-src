As doom-and-gloom swung to LFG, The HEGE Experience Vol. 1 premiered, and Hege
Jetpack Madness entered app stores. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

**_For the week of September 29 – October 5_**

And just like that, the crypto market has tilted back to full-on bull mode
again. One week the sky is falling, the next it's back to unicorns and euphoria. We take wild swings like this to be a clear sign that altseason is still
building, and we're more committed than ever to make the most out of the
coming months.

Let's jump in to this week's update!

## Fake-dump done, back to LFG-mode!

Last week the sentiment was awful all around crypto, as bitcoin et al all sold
off heavily, liquidating traders to the tune of billions of dollars. Our take
was that it was an over-reaction though, and we had this to say:

> These two facts make this dump look like a temporary correction, caused by
> market makers flushing out leveraged positions.

> If this assessment is correct, crypto markets should turn up again within the
> next couple of weeks. So let's keep watching.

And yes, that turned out to be the correct take: as of writing this on Sunday
morning, BTC just put in a new ATH. Of course, the week is not over until
midnight, but it looks like daddy bitcoin will put in a strong weekly close here. And
where daddy goes, altcoins eventually follow.

There is of course still the slight chance that this breakout will turn out to
be a fake-out, leading to a new dump. But this is very much not the main
scenario right now. Bitcoin breaking out into new highs is extremely bullish.
Period. It can now continue towards the price target of $142k. Remember that we
first set this target all the way back on July 13th, and we have maintained it
every single week since then.

Also note that all along we've said that this is a *conservative* price target.
Bitcoin will likely end up going even higher before this cycle is over.

LFG!

## The HEGE Experience, Vol. 1

Turning to Hege now. On Friday, we held the premiere of our new X Spaces initiative: The HEGE Experience.

The HEGE Experience will be a weekly X Space, every Friday, where we'll bring
updates, partnerships, and special guests. The show will be hosted by our friend
[Charlie (@deftony83)](https://x.com/deftony83), a real spaces veteran. 

On Friday's show, Charlie had invited some of the artists from the Hege Mural
Tour to share their experience creating some of the most iconic Hege murals.
