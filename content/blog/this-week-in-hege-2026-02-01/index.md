Stop doomscrolling you monkeybrain. Tune in to the Hege vibe and join the Hege
Royale fun instead. Welcome to This Week in $HEGE!

<!--more-->

*For the week of Jan 26 – Feb 1, 2026.*


## GM Hegends!

Actually it's afternoon here in a freezing Sweden, but GM Hegends is how I
always start these Sunday updates. So GM it is! Hope you all had a good week
fam, the market mayhem notwithstanding. 

With the sentiment in crypto being what it is, and retail being nowhere to be
seen, there are no big news this week. But there's always something going on in
the community. So read on for an update on Hege Royale, and the progress
with the Hege website.

Let's dive in!

## Check Out the New Features in Hege Royale

If you haven't seen it already, Hege Royale is the new Hege-themed multiplayer
battle game by community member Larva.

We covered this back in December when it was first released. But since then,
Larva has kept working on it and added a bunch of new features — there's now a
voice-chat, daily social rewards, and more!

Check out the gameplay footage below, then hop into Hegequarters and join the
fun!

## Hege Website Move 90% Done

It took longer than expected, but progress has been steady. The mobile version
is now complete, and after some tweaks to the desktop version, the whole
thing will be ready for release.

It should be done within two weeks, and then we can get rid off our Webflow
subscription. That's 250 USD per month that we now can spend on something else,
or save until the market improves. As an added bonus, the new site will be
much faster, too. So not only cheaper, but faster as well – can't beat that!
