Yo yo has been with Hege since the earliest days, a true OG in the League of Hegends. On his own initiative, and never for profit, he’s sent over 277 sticker packages <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNKztrlR9U" target="_blank">around the world</a>, spreading Hege like a <a href="https://youtu.be/H7AzdGhhqtc?si=IX0VLiMPd4YDLyzl" target="_blank">sleeper</a> that never stops spinning.</p>
<p>
Details about him are scarce, but his username hints at power beyond measure, maybe even enough to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k25KK79-E4" target="_blank">split the atom</a>. What we do know is that yo yo keeps the community looping together: <a href="https://youtu.be/aCxQkb_xMFw?si=x7yD1cfEwJcFM6i1" target="_blank">walking the dog</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oYiUkbBC6dY?si=tI_M30mfdRzyyQz0" target="_blank">rocking the baby</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/NMGvkQvqeFs?si=4a4V6TRFEshxWQ58" target="_blank">eiffel towering</a> his generosity, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvdIQOd67xg" target="_blank">Around the corner</a> with every new drop, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-V9KngiL2Y" target="_blank">brain twister</a>-level dedication that no one saw coming.
</p>
<p>
Some heroes fight with swords, others with words. Yo yo fights with stickers. He’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_-zympXLB8" target="_blank">man on the flying trapeze</a>, keeping the vibe alive with every package. And just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syYF_zV0h5g" target="_blank">boingy-boing</a> or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFBKNwssCio" target="_blank">loop the loop</a>, no matter how far he travels, he always comes back to Hege. Catch him if you can, but don’t get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWgFvqmXmUg" target="_blank">strung</a> along.
