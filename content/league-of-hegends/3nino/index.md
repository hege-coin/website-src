What can we say about 3nino? The Italian stallion.

He's a working man by night and a Hegend at day, driven by a mission to slap
stickers throughout the home of the Romans. He's been here as long as hedgehogs
have existed (well, we think) and no matter what the market looks like, keeps
his spikes out.

Dependable, bullish, and hard-working, he does as the Romans did — dominates.
