Hege, a standout boy in a school of cats and dogs, has had a tough start in

more than a hopeful heart that he would once share a love like his parents,
minus the roadkill.

        Hege, a standout boy in a school of cats and dogs, has had a tough start in life. Growing up without his
        parents, our poor boi Hege was left with nothing more than a hopeful heart that he would once share a love like
        his parents, minus the roadkill.

            Hege is an old skl romantic, his heart has always twinkled for a reason far closer to earth, that reason was
            called Hegena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hege was a shy skl boi, so admiring Hegena from a distance was the safest bet. Hege kept a diary, crafting
            love
            notes and longing for that hedge-hug with his childhood sweetheart. Until one day, a chad called Hendrix
            stumbled across Hege’s diary and thought he was being Hedgey by making our boi the target of his teasing.

            Hege was violated, made a mockery and his secret love for Hegena was now exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hegena was never one for bullying but her desire to meet a Hege with big dreams, big money and a big c*ck
            overruled any of Hege’s heart-felt sentiments. It was at this moment, Hege needed this ammunition to make it
            his
            life’s mission to win Hegena’s heart and be the upcoming Alpha.

        Hege wanted to thank everyone for the support. It's all quite overwhelming for him. He will see you soon in
        chapter 2...
