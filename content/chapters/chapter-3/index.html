      <div class="text-block-21">Hege, went thrifting and found the perfect tuxedo, strolling into the party as a
        stylish bag of nerves. His heart was set on impressing Hegena and reclaiming his rightful place by her side.
        That night, Hege took a seat across from Hendrix at the poker table. The stakes were high, and so were Hege’s
        hopes. With his life savings pushed to the middle of the table, this bold all-or-nothing gesture meant Hege
        was all in both heart and mind. He needed this win, and so the risk seemed worthwhile, given the opportunity
        of proving to Hegena he was more than just a background character in her life.<br /><br />Hendrix, the ever so
        charming antagonist, gazed at Hege with a grin as he took his seat at the table. The game began and Hege
        played his hands full of strategy and boldness for someone who had everything to gain. Hege held his own. His
        confidence grew as he accumulated nods of respect from those surrounding the table, including Hegena. Yet,
        unbeknownst to Hege and the other players, Hendrix had planted one of his chads at the table, tasked with a
        subtle yet deceitful role of manipulating the game. Through a series of cunning signals, Hege remained
        oblivious to the deceit across the table, enabling Hendrix to manipulate the game with shocking precision.

      <div class="text-block-20">In total horror, Hegena caught a glimpse of Hendrix&#x27;s cruel tactics, as the
        dreadful truth lay before her. During the final hand, while Hege sat blissfully unaware, Hendrix made his
        pre-calculated move, a move of poker collusion. Hege’s dreams of finally proving himself crashed in front of
        him, his savings wiped, and his heart shattered under the weight of double betrayal - not only by his rival
        but indirectly by his beloved Hegena who he assumed to be a pawn in Hendrix’s master plan to humiliate
        him.<br /><br />Hegena, witnessing the unfair defeat, felt a mix of guilt and disillusionment. The image of
        Hendrix she held so dear crumbled before her eyes. Her heart ached at the realisation that Hendrix’s
        invitation for Hege was a cruel trick, exposing her own foolish trust.</div>

        completely surrounded him. This wasn’t the life Hege wanted to lead. Hege wanted to live with boldness and
        courage, to lead a life his parents would be proud of. As Hege reflected on his early childhood as baby Hege,
        he remembered his mom telling him, son, why are you trying so hard to fit in when you are born to stand
        out?<br /><br />With fire in his belly, Hege marched back into the room with unwavering conviction. The room
        was completely silent as Hege stood up on the stage and addressed a room full of familiar strangers. Hege made
        the following vow...</div>

        longer stand with fear of being dismissed. I’m choosing to stand with courage and promise. I strive to be a
        beacon of hope for all of you out there that are underdogs, those who have been left behind and forgotten and
        those that were made to feel so insignificant by the Hendrix’s in this world. I refuse to be defined by your
        mockery and shame.<br /><br />Tonight, well tonight, I’m rising above … I want to champion the voices of those
        that have been silent for too long. I want to form a nation that can be united by our shared experiences and
        resilience. Together, we will somehow form the path to success, but embarking on this journey will mean
        leading with courage and integrity, a decision which I’m no longer afraid to grab by the
        spikes.<br /><br />For those of you who dare to dream, and those that want to be successful and bold, come
